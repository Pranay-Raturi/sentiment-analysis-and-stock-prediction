1751014110433615950,2024-01-26 22:47:50+00:00,"Another good week for my investment portfolio, mostly driven by $SMCI with some help from $MELI $NU $DKNG $TDW $TMDX $META 

Here are my top 14 positions:
$SMCI $CELH $TMDX $FOUR $UBER $LNTH $AMD $MELI $META $DKNG $TDW $NU $ONON $NVDA

YTD performance: +20.32%

7 of my top 14 positions are up double digits in 2024 but $SMCI is still responsible for 70% of my total returns this year (including the hedges)

My hedging strategy has been working perfectly because not only is $ARKK down -12.3% YTD (this is my primary hedge) but there's been alot of days where I cover my hedges pre-market or at the open (for gain or loss) then $ARKK and/or $IWM rip higher in the morning then get rejected at some resistance level so I add back my hedges and generate alpha on the reversals, sometimes this will happen several times throughout the day. 

Here's a breakdown of my YTD performance:
open positions (stocks/longs): +12.59%
closed positions (stocks/longs): +2.98%
open positions (hedges): +0.10%
closed positions (hedges): 4.65% 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Net Real Estate Investments Value: $685,173
Tax Sheltered Stock Portfolio Value: $115,318 annualized YTD return of (2.73) & +1.0% on the week.

Portfolio Moves this week:
-Still letting my outsized $NVDA position run. Largest position by far at over 14% weighting.
-Re-entered a position in Global-E $GLBE at $37.25/share.
-Also started a position in Sea Limited $SE at $36.02.  Nice run of ~10% in the couple days since initiating the position.
-Added to my position in Coupang $CPNG at $14.93.  Now up to a full 5% weight.
-Exited a very small speculative position in Jumia $JMIA.  Started digging deep into reviews and found absolutely terrible consumer reviews from 2023.  All 1 star reviews with all 3-5 star reviews being 2+ years old.  Countless reports of customers not being able to contact customer service for refunds, not receiving their order but being charged, or receiving used/damaged or wrong products with no recourse. Also Nigeria inflation came in at 29% for Dec.  Not being profitable, Jumia can not have many more bad quarters and things are not looking good in the short term.

Other Investment Happenings:
-Have an accepted offer to sell an investment rental party, with the intent to further diversify our net wealth into stocks and to maximize contributions to our tax sheltered accounts.
-Net proceeds of sale after fees and taxes will be approximately $130K and will be closing near the end of March.
-Then I will have the difficult task of trying to deploy this into the market, more than doubling my stock exposure.  Given that the market has been strong, I will mostly slowly pick at some opportunities and have the remainder in high interest savings ready to deploy on overall market weakness.

The governor is correct that this is a Dojo Supercomputer, but $500M, while obviously a large sum of money, is only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia.

Commentary: I am happy to close out week 4 with big numbers. Best week of the month and I was able to exceed my monthly goal of $6,000. I am well positioned with CCs and advanced options for February but I will need to identify new and more opportunities for CSPs. I am very cautious as most of the tickers I sell puts on are over-extended in terms of RSI (daily/weekly) and also well above MA 100/200.

1750961012407194094,2024-01-26 19:16:51+00:00,"Biden Admin Sells Federal Helium Reserve, Threatening US Industry & National Security

The US government is selling off the Federal Helium Reserve, which is a large subterranean stockpile located in Amarillo, Texas.

The Helium stockpile provides up to 30% of the nation's reserves of this rare element with critical purposes for the medical field, industrial manufacturing, and national security.

The top bidder will own about 425 miles of pipelines spanning Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma, as well as around 1 billion cubic feet of the only element on Earth cold enough to make an MRI machine operate. 

NBC News reports that, ""Regulatory and logistical issues with the facility threaten a temporary shutdown as it passes from public to private ownership, and hospital supply chain experts worry the sale could have serious consequences for health care down the road ‚Äî especially when it comes to MRIs.""

""The sale of the government‚Äôs stockpile of the nonrenewable element could exacerbate an existing supply shortage,"" medical industry expert Soumi Saha  told NBC News.

Indeed, Helium is vital not only to the medical field for use in MRIs, but it has critical use for cryogenics, semiconductors, superconductors, and rocket technology.

The Impact of Selling the Federal Helium Reserve from the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2000) discusses ""The Impact of Selling the Federal Helium Reserve."" https://t.co/X8edTLmYIW.

CRYOGENICS

""The largest current use of helium is for cryogenics. The amount of helium used for cryogenics was about 620 million scf (17 million scm) in 1996. The main cryogenic applications to be discussed in this section are magnetic resonance imaging, semiconductor processing, and large-scale and small-scale fundamental research that requires helium temperatures.""

MRI 

""The main medical use of liquid helium is for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. Liquid helium is needed as a refrigerant for the superconducting magnets that are critical components in many of these devices. The availability of helium at a favorable price and the stability of the helium market have contributed to the rapid growth of MRI as a diagnostic tool and have allowed it to make a significant contribution to health care in the United States.""

SEMICONDUCTORS

""Silicon wafer suppliers are the primary users of helium in the semiconductor industry... activities in the industry that use helium are plasma etching and vacuum pumping...""

""[I]t is very important to this key industry. An increase in the price of helium could be accommodated, but if helium were to disappear altogether, semiconductor processing would be severely hampered.""

ROCKET PROPULSION SYSTEMS

""Helium plays a unique and critical role in the pressurizing and purging of primary rocket propulsion systems. It will continue to do so as long as the propellant is a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. First, helium gas is used to pressurize the propellant tanks for the engines. In this application, pressure is provided to prevent pump cavitation and must be sufficient to keep the tanks from collapsing under vehicle-imposed structural loads. Pressure-fed propulsion systems are also used to provide engine-chamber pressurization. Second, helium gas is used for the purging of the propellant feed systems for liquid-hydrogen engines. Helium is used because its normal boiling point is lower than that of hydrogen. Thus it is the only element that can be used without compromising propellant integrity or feed-system function. Other gases would freeze, producing particles that could clog equipment and seize an engine, or react with or dissolve in the liquid hydrogen, reducing engine efficiency, all with potentially disastrous results.""

Thus, the Biden administration by selling off its Federal Helium Stockpile is undermining U.S. industrial manufacturing vital to National Security and the medical field.

As a political backdrop, the Biden action targets Texas, which is currently locked in a standoff with the federal government over border security.

On Friday, the Biden administration announced that it is considering a freeze on Liquefied Natural Gas exports, which would seriously damage the U.S. economy, and most severely, Texas' economy.",6754,4336,"Dallas, TX"

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Buyer beware.",3812,857,

OK I get that Intel is in the #DOWJONES average not Nvidia.
But if, for example, one year ago they replaced Intel with Nvidia the Dow (based 1 yr change (399.6) and the current Dow Divisor of 0.151727526) would 40,673 be 2,635 points higher than it is now (38,038).",0,0,

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Your office has tightened restrictions on AI chips being sold to countries listed in the act. This means that Nvidia's $NVDA RTX 4090 is subject to export restrictions starting from November 17th.

Consequently, the RTX 4090 should not be available for sale in these countries, and Nvidia is expected to take proactive actions to ensure compliance. 

However, as of today, January 26, two months later, I have contacted several distributors in China, and they all have the RTX 4090 in stock and available for sale and in immediate delivery.

@SecRaimondo , to my understanding, the U.S. government expects companies to take reasonable steps to ensure their products are not sold in ways that violate export controls. This includes conducting due diligence and implementing measures to prevent unauthorized sales. Even if a company sells its products to a third party, which subsequently sells them to China, the original company could still be held accountable.

A New Era Dawns: Bitcoin ETFs Arrive with Potential to Shake Up Investing

After years of anticipation, the first Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) finally received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year. 

This landmark decision marks a significant moment for the #cryptocurrency  industry, potentially opening up Bitcoin exposure to a wider range of investors, including those who prefer traditional investment vehicles.

Who's in the Game?

Several firms were at the forefront of the Bitcoin ETF race. These launches represent only the beginning, with numerous other applications still pending from established players.

One brokerage firm in particular, Vanguard, has publicly stated that they will not allow clients to access $BTC ETFs.

While it's still early days, the $4.6 billion of trading on the first day these products hit the exchanges could serve as a signal for what's to come.

Check out my post below to see which fintech company I think could really benefit from inflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Hint: It's NOT $HOOD

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Buyer beware.",3812,857,

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

I plan on releasing my dashboard very soon. It will most likely be subscription based (Patreon) for small fee. This is very much BETA as I keep working on it but a lot of people asked about it so I think it's time others take advantage of this powerful tool.

It is Excel based so Office 365 subscription is preferred as you'll have access to live market data as well as historic stock data.

It does not support option trading unfortunately, nor short positions at this time. I built it around Fidelity brokerage but other brokerage logs can be converted as well.

I'll talk more about it later. Stay tuned!

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

2. Only obscure companies buying $NVDA's chips. üôàüôàüôà

Mag7 is bragging about how much they could get. See image.

3. All chip manufacturers have said they probably saw the bottom and from now it will go up. This has to do with channel stuffing. The chips are there and were used and that's why this downcycle will be shorter than previous ones. This is basic knowledge for everyone following chips.

4. $NVDA also works with Samsung and $INTC and $TSM knows all too well that if it raises prices too much, NVDA will give more volume to the others.",6,0,

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Your office has tightened restrictions on AI chips being sold to countries listed in the act. This means that Nvidia's $NVDA RTX 4090 is subject to export restrictions starting from November 17th.

Consequently, the RTX 4090 should not be available for sale in these countries, and Nvidia is expected to take proactive actions to ensure compliance. 

However, as of today, January 26, two months later, I have contacted several distributors in China, and they all have the RTX 4090 in stock and available for sale and in immediate delivery.

@SecRaimondo , to my understanding, the U.S. government expects companies to take reasonable steps to ensure their products are not sold in ways that violate export controls. This includes conducting due diligence and implementing measures to prevent unauthorized sales. Even if a company sells its products to a third party, which subsequently sells them to China, the original company could still be held accountable.

1750837780559642838,2024-01-26 11:07:10+00:00,"Good Morning to @SecRaimondo 's Department of Commerce!

Your office has tightened restrictions on AI chips being sold to countries listed in the act. This means that Nvidia's $NVDA RTX 4090 is subject to export restrictions starting from November 17th.

Consequently, the RTX 4090 should not be available for sale in these countries, and Nvidia is expected to take proactive actions to ensure compliance. 

However, as of today, January 26, two months later, I have contacted several distributors in China, and they all have the RTX 4090 in stock and available for sale and in immediate delivery.

@SecRaimondo , to my understanding, the U.S. government expects companies to take reasonable steps to ensure their products are not sold in ways that violate export controls. This includes conducting due diligence and implementing measures to prevent unauthorized sales. Even if a company sells its products to a third party, which subsequently sells them to China, the original company could still be held accountable.

I would describe this situation as ""willful blindness."" What are your thoughts? ü§î",17,3,Far Far Away

1750816983074173267,2024-01-26 09:44:32+00:00,Interesting take on the evidence around the #ai economy. Basically no one but $nvda making money.,2,0,"Melbourne, Victoria"
1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Buyer beware.",3812,857,

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Buyer beware.",3812,857,

These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Buyer beware.",3812,857,

Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

1750698397890162859,2024-01-26 01:53:19+00:00,"The semiconductor industry is screaming at us that AI is all hype.  Yes, lots of orders for H100 GPUs, but even an AI datacenter still needs CPUs, memory, and HDs.  Then you have AI implementation, such as in computer vision and controls, robotics, etc, which require specialized chips for efficient compute.

The companies that provide these things are all telling us that AI is not going to deliver the types of growth people are foaming at the mouth for.

$INTC revenues down 14% YoY.  Net earnings down 78% YoY.  They make the CPUs that go in the servers.

$AMD releases earnings next week which are pivotal, but Q3 showed revenues down 8% YTD, earnings down 85% YTD.  They also make CPUs that go in the servers.

$MU makes memory.  Revenues up 15% YoY but they have had negative earnings for over a year. 

Samsung memory chip earnings have dropped 78% YoY.

$WDC also makes hard drives and memory.  They just posted revenues down 2% YoY and more than a year of net losses.

$TXN makes all sorts of chips necessary for AI, such as computer vision processors and robot automation chips.  Their revenues are down 13% YoY and their net income is down 30% YoY.

In short, hardware sucks for AI.  Except for 1 company.  $NVDA.  Revenue up 206% YoY,  net income up 1200% YoY.  Even $TSMC, the company that makes the chips for $NVDA, has had a 1.5% YoY revenue decline and an earnings decline of 19% YoY.

$NVDA has so far this year sold about $30B of datacenter equipment.  These are primarily A100 and H100 chips, which are 5nm processes.  $TSMC reports that about 35% of chips they ship are 5nm in 2nd half 2023.  Before that it was variable (as apple moves down to 3nm and others move from 7 to 5), but the lowest number was around 20%.  So let's give $NVDA the benefit of the doubt and say 15% of the chips they make are likely for $NVDA and lets say half are for data centers.  All told this year, that's $5B of revenue for $TSMC to make A100 and H100 chips.

Then on the $NVDA side, they have made around $30B on AI chips this year, putting their margin around 600%.  Others have estimated 800%.  So nobody, not even $NVDA's supplier, has ANY pricing power to accommodate this demand.  Nobody is making money except for $NVDA.

Then we move to the cloud side.  Pricing is pretty transparent for some specialty LLM AI cloud services like Coreweave and Lambda Labs.  They have been selling compute on the H100 for about $100/day.  If they are paying $40k a pop, then it will take over a year just to break even on the chip, and most likely will take 2-3 years.  This is longer than the likely life of the chip.  So the cloud providers also do not have the pricing power to make money off of AI.

At one point I looked through the listed AI partners for $ORCL, who has been given preferential treatment by $NVDA since they aren't trying to compete with their own chips.  The partners of any significant size are all companies that $NVDA has heavily invested in, or Larry Ellison's own bio institute.  Hardly a who's who of titans of organic demand.

In fact, everywhere you look, most of the activity is localized to private start ups.  Many of them are funded in part by $NVDA.  I have even found some start ups that boast having more H100 chips than their entire raised capital to date.  There's little transparency into their books, and many of them likely are not profitable, nor never will be.  

So to summarize.  The people who make hardware for AI compute are all losing money except for $NVDA.  The people who provide cloud compute to train LLMs are selling H100 compute time at a loss.  The people using the cloud compute are likely running on fumes with venture capital money, some of which came from $NVDA.

So the industry is absolutely running on hype, as people scramble to capture the money flowing out of VC funds.  To be fair, there are some cool things coming out of these LLMs.  Nearly instant voice translations are pretty cool.  The chat bot is sort of neat.  I've heard some good things about the code generation, although admittedly reviews are very mixed and polarized.  The image generation seems cool but it looks likely that they will be required to pay royalties to artists.   None of these things is $1T a year industry.

But that's not the hype people have been sold.  They have been sold on the imminent creation of artificial general intelligence.  An intelligence so advanced it can out-perform a human in cognitive and perhaps physical tasks.  The problem?  LLMs cannot, by themselves, ever achieve this.  They are just extremely large regressions to existing data.  They simply collage together an output based on an input.  It cannot reason.  It cannot think.  It cannot truly create something outside of its training.  It's missing fundamental components of intelligence that nobody has solutions for.

So you have a fundamental misunderstanding by investors about the capabilities of the technology, fueled by a technologically ignorant media, on one side.  And mega-cap technology companies willing to spend vast amounts of money to maintain dominance (and find palatable excuses to raise prices without drawing too much ire for anti-trust practices) on the other side.  The result is a fever dream where only those hyping the technology appear to be making any money, and not the people building it.

Eventually the fever will break and we will be left with a massive misallocation of capital and a lot of broken hearts.

Insider trading in the U.S. is a serious offense. Nancy Pelosi, however, has been successfully trading stocks of companies concurrently negotiating with the government. For instance, Nvidia's. ( $NVDA )

The stocks she bought increased by 25%. But Pelosi, actually, purchased options. They costed around $1.8 million and are now worth nearly $510 each, up by 35%, which equals an unrealized income of $630,000. Pelosi's official annual salary before taxes is $223,500.

$INTC is an example of how if you stop learning, creating, and innovating... you DIE.

Intel released the Pentium 4 in 2000 and sat on its throne releasing mediocre iterations of the same chip while #AMD innovated, creating the Athlon XP series, becoming the first to release home consumer 64-bit CPUs, and then created multicore CPUs, years before Intel grew a brain and realized end-consumers wanted these things.

Intel finally got off its ass and created the Core 2 Duo in 2006 (a fantastic processor, by the way), but not until $AMD had clawed its way back from the brink of death to become a formidable opponent.

#AMD bought GPU-manufacturer ATI in 2006. ATI created cards that were good on bang-for-the-buck performance, but ATI never beat #Nvidia on innovation.

Fast forward 18 years and AMD still hasn't been able to leapfrog $NVDA's innovation.

Could it happen one day? Could AMD become the leader? Sure.

But, life ISN'T a Disney movie. There are no promises or guarantees that the underdog will ever become the leader, and this is the case with AMD vs. Nvidia in GPU development.

As long as Nvidia continues to innovate, AMD, Intel, and the rest of the semiconductor world simply cannot catch up to the headstart that the genius who is Jensen Huang created when he saw #AI years before anyone else.ü§∑

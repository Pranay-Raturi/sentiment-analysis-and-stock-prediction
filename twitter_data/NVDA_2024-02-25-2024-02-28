Reddit is a social media platform and online community where users can share, discuss, and vote on content in various categories known as ""subreddits."" 

Founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, Reddit has grown into one of the most popular websites on the internet, boasting millions of active users and a vast array of user-generated content.

At its core, Reddit is a forum-based website organized around communities called subreddits, each dedicated to a specific topic, interest, or theme. 

These subreddits cover virtually every subject imaginable, from technology and science to sports, politics, gaming, memes, and beyond. Users can join existing subreddits or create their own, allowing them to engage with like-minded individuals and participate in discussions on topics of interest.

In addition to posting and voting on content, users can comment on posts, engaging in discussions and debates with other users within the subreddit. 

Reddit also features a messaging system that allows users to communicate privately with each other, as well as a system of awards and badges that users can give to posts and comments as a form of recognition or appreciation.

One of Reddit's defining features is its sense of community and democratized content moderation. Each subreddit is moderated by volunteer moderators who enforce the subreddit's rules and guidelines, ensuring that discussions remain civil and on-topic. 

Reddit makes money primarily through advertising and, to a lesser extent, through data licensing.

Reddit offers access to anonymized user data and insights to third-party partners and advertisers through its data licensing program. 

This data includes information such as user demographics, interests, browsing behavior, and engagement patterns.

Advertisers and marketers can leverage Reddit's data to better understand their target audience, optimize ad targeting and campaign performance, and inform their marketing strategies across other platforms.

Reddit just filed it S-1, known as a prospectus. This is meant to provide investors with a wealth of information before Reddit goese public.

One of the more interesting tidbits I found in the S-1 was Reddit's ownership structure. While most of the company is owned by insiders and VC's, one investor in particular stuck out.

Sam Altman. Sam Altman is a prominent entrepreneur, investor, and technologist known for his contributions to the startup ecosystem and his involvement in the tech industry. 

He gained recognition as the former president of Y Combinator (YC), one of the world's most prestigious startup accelerators.

Aside from his role at Y Combinator, Altman is also known for his investments in numerous successful startups, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, and many others. He is a prolific angel investor and has been involved in funding some of the most iconic companies in Silicon Valley.

Sam Altman's relationship with Reddit primarily stems from his investment in the company. Altman previously participated in a funding round for Reddit, leading a $50 million investment in Reddit alongside other investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and individual angel investors.

In the post below, I've outlined how I view the Reddit IPO. The company has a fiercly loyal user base, but is that enough to fend off competition from other social media platforms?

Dig in below to read my take on Reddit's investment prospects and whether you should follow Altman into the IPO.",0,0,Check it out ‚Üí

Business Development Companies (BDCs) are a type of investment company that specialize in providing financing and capital to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). 

BDCs were created to stimulate the flow of capital to privately-held companies that may not have access to traditional sources of financing, such as bank loans or public equity markets.

BDCs operate similarly to venture capital or private equity firms but are publicly traded entities that offer retail investors access to private market investments. 

They typically raise capital from investors through initial public offerings (IPOs) or secondary offerings and then deploy that capital into a portfolio of debt and equity investments in private companies. 

BDCs may provide various forms of financing to their portfolio companies, including senior secured loans, subordinated debt, mezzanine financing, and equity investments.

One of the primary investment vehicles offered by BDCs is debt financing in the form of loans or bonds to SMBs. These loans often come with higher interest rates compared to traditional bank loans, reflecting the higher risk associated with lending to smaller and potentially less-established businesses. 

BDCs may also invest in equity securities of their portfolio companies, taking ownership stakes in exchange for providing capital. Additionally, some BDCs may engage in direct lending, where they originate and hold loans on their balance sheets, or invest in syndicated loans alongside other lenders.

BDCs typically carry a high dividend yield because they are required by law to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain their favorable tax treatment as pass-through entities. This distribution requirement often results in high dividend yields for BDCs.

In the post below, I've outlined three leading BDCs that could help generate $10K of dividend income for your portfolio this year.

All three of these BDCs are proven leaders in their respective spaces, and historically are generous dividend payers.",0,1,Check it out ‚Üí

Today I swapped all my NVIDIA for TESLA and my friends think I am crazy.

I was 'lucky' to buy NVIDIA in 2022 at $160, $NVDA is at $788 today.

This was even way before AI even was a thing (ChatGPT wasn't launched yet).

My thesis then was very simple actually. Nvidia's stock was way down because of logistic troubles in the aftermath of COVID-19. I thought that was an opportunity, NVIDIA has the best GPUs and these logistic issues are just temporary. And GPUs are needed for gaming, mining, and for AI in the future. 

But the future of AI was closer than expected and NVIDIA blew up.

But today, I am moving on. I don't think NVIDIA is a bad stock today, but I want to move my capital to a faster horse.

I always think about it like,

'what does it take to double the stock price in the short term?'

Well, after NVIDIA surpassed Apple and Google in company value, I don't see it happening that quick from here on out. How are they going to do it? Double the prices of their GPUs?

Also, NVIDIA will get competition. Not only in their core business but also as an 'AI stock'. There are so few quality AI stocks to buy that it feels that everyone has been buying NVIDIA as their 'AI play'. I ask myself, what if OpenAI does an IPO? Or Anthropic? They will go public soon in my opinion. 

What will happen? People will sell their NVIDIA for these new shiny AI stocks.

Meanwhile, we have TESLA, valued as a car company but actually a big AI & Robotics player. Now all the attention in AI is to Large Language Models (ChatGPT, ...). But AI is so much more, fully self-driving cars, robotics, etc. Areas where TESLA excels. 

And Tesla is valued at $0.63T compared to Nvidia at $2T.

So, I see more opportunity for TESLA to double short term than NVIDIA.

Don't get me wrong, I think the AI hype in stocks has still a long way to go. But my thesis is that Nvidia will underperform from now on.",3,0,

Sirius Satellite Radio, now known as SiriusXM $SIRI is a subscription-based satellite radio service provider operating primarily in the United States. 

The company offers a wide range of audio entertainment content, including music, sports, news, talk shows, comedy, and more, delivered via satellite and streaming technology to subscribers' vehicles, homes, and mobile devices.

$SIRI generates revenue primarily through subscription fees paid by its 34 million subscribers. Customers can choose from various subscription packages offering different channel lineups and access options. 

The company also earns revenue through advertising on select channels and partnerships with automakers, which integrate SiriusXM's services into their vehicles as a factory-installed feature.

In terms of competition, $SIRI faces competition from various audio entertainment providers, including traditional AM/FM radio, streaming music services like Spotify $SPOT and Apple Music, and podcast platforms such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Stitcher. 

To maintain its competitive edge, SiriusXM continues to invest in exclusive content, partnerships, and technological innovations to enhance its service offerings and attract and retain subscribers. 

The company's extensive channel lineup, including exclusive content and live sports coverage, remains a key differentiator, helping it to retain a loyal subscriber base despite increasing competition in the audio entertainment industry.

Last quarter, Warren Buffett LOADED up on $SIRI stock. In the memo below, I've outlined why some investors may be attracted to $SIRI given its recurring revenue stream.

However, intense competition coupled with big money being thrown at exclusive content seems like a formular we've seen before.

1762542848338264066,2024-02-27 18:18:56+00:00,"Many market and financial historians see the Radio Corporation of America, RCA, as the quintessential example of an overvalued stock that represents the broader irrational exuberance of a bubble market. RCA was one of, if not the most, highly anticipated IPO of 1924. It controlled a huge share of the flourishing radio market in the country. Nation-wide sales of radios for all companies in 1920 was less than $5M and had hit $350M in 1924. In 1921 there were 5 radio stations. By 1923 there were 556. Radio was growing incredibly fast in the 1920s. AT&T sold off its radio stations to RCA in 1926. RCA was such a dominant player in the radio industry that there was an anti-trust suit against the company in the 1920s which was dropped.

Although it was called the 'Radio' Corporation of America, it is important to note that RCA was much more than a radio stock, and it was one of the most technologically advanced publicly traded companies of its day and had operations in several hot sectors. Not only did RCA lead the radio industry by making and selling more radios than any other company, but they also had radio stations, sold vacuum tubes, were at the forefront of sound and video recording, helped pioneer television, and even created the National Broadcasting Company, NBC.  

In 1927, the first movie with talking actors was released. This brought about many changes to both the sound recording and film industries, and RCA played a large role in both.  RCA developed systems for synchronizing music and sound with film. Their partnership with Victor Talking Machines, the largest manufacturer of record players in the country, helped to increase their footprint in the sound recording and music space. It also gave them access to the musicians that Victor had signed and became the basis of RCA Records, their record label.

A major cutting edge technology of the time was television. Commonly referred to as ""radio pictures,"" the wireless transmission of movies and the idea of live broadcasting of news and events with the accompaniment of synchronized sound was a revolutionary advancement in technology. Radio companies were seen as the natural beneficiaries of this emerging technology and surely played a part in the wild speculation in RCA and other radio companies' stock.

Things to pay attention to: 
1‚É£ Dispersion trade: You can see a subtle move from Tech to other places in the market, while indexes are still pins and do not move anywhere.
If heavyweights like $GOOG $MSFT $NVDA $APPL go down 0.2% it's enough for other stocks to go up 3-5% to keep the indexes on the same level. 
2‚É£ Low volume. You should have hearing aid to hear the market :-)
3‚É£ Window of weakness does not materialize, in a very sensitive time of the year. This means we're probably heading up, and as long as the indexes do not move much, it may be cheap to look for mid March and mid April calls. 
4‚É£ Macro bears and doomers can't help now, although their content is (So) interesting. We're at the beginning of a blow of top mode, not the end of it.

Many people are looking beyond the¬†medical sector¬†for alternative diets and lifestyles.

Rise of the carnivores

Due to soaring costs, many insurers and employers have limited access to these drugs. The GLP-1 drugs have reignited the weight-loss trend and the search for the perfect diet.

People who don't want to resort to expensive and potentially harmful GLP-1 drugs have taken up more holistic diets like the carnivore diet, which involves eating only animal proteins and fats. Ketogenic diets allow for a limited amount of carbohydrates from vegetables.

Gen AI is no doubt transformational.  

But it is not without challenges...

AI is Hungry | AI computing‚Äôs energy density and space needs exceed current hyperscale data center capabilities.¬† Energy demand for AI is projected to exceed the entire current data center levels.¬† Some estimates put it at 20-30GW. 5GW of demand in 2024 alone.

AI is Thirsty | Traditional data centers, particularly those utilized for AI, exhibit substantial water consumption.¬† Microsoft used an estimated equivalent of 2.8 Million glasses of water to train ChatGPT-3 due to the current cooling design of traditional data centers.

AI is Dirty | Traditional data centers are responsible for 2% of overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. GPT-3, Gopher, BLOOM, and OPT had more than 900 tonnes of carbon emissions.

That acquisition is now responsible for maybe 80% of that value (read the attached 2019 press release to get a sense of why). It reminds me of when Activision bought Call of Duty maker Infinity Ward for $5M and gained billions on that game to become the world‚Äôs largest video game company. Except the NVIDIA acquisition is making them a contender for the world‚Äôs biggest company.

I made a ton of money on that acquisition, but I didn‚Äôt reinvest those big gains into NVDA. I don‚Äôt know if Eyal Waldman, the CEO and co-founder of that Israeli company Mellanox, whose innovations are now moving mountains, and who was a proponent of peace hiring Palestinians‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if he reinvested his gains into $NVDA. He probably didn‚Äôt. But it doesn‚Äôt matter when you consider the context... no amount of money could possibly replace losing his daughter at that festival massacre in Israel.

While this investment game is full of shock and drama and savvy and envy and luck with people and companies making amazing decisions and others totally missing out or selling out too soon, the losses and rewards, the victories and suffering, are only as important as we pretend they are. In reality, we‚Äôre all just a bunch of privileged people benefiting from the overall riches of first world life and all this extra money and investment is just a game that we shouldn‚Äôt ever forget we‚Äôd instantly trade for health, for love, for getting back years, or for getting back a life.

üëâ Key Details:

üìç Microsoft's investment in French tech startup Mistral AI triggers EU investigation concerns.

üìç The deal involves a ‚Ç¨15 million investment, with potential equity conversion in Mistral's next funding round.

üìç Mistral, valued at ‚Ç¨2 billion, previously backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed.

üìç EU lawmakers alarmed by potential concentration of power, recalling Microsoft's OpenAI partnership concerns.

üìç Microsoft's strategic investments in AI under antitrust review in both the EU and the U.S.

üìç The EU's AI Act discussions intensified by Mistral's lobbying for exemptions, raising questions on startup's motivations.

üëâ Context/Background:

For those new to the topic, Microsoft's strategic partnerships and investments in AI startups like Mistral and OpenAI have drawn regulatory attention for potentially concentrating power and breaching competition rules.

üëâ Why This Matters:

üìç The scrutiny over Microsoft's AI deals highlights growing regulatory concerns over big tech's influence in the AI sector.

üìç Such investigations could set precedents affecting future tech investments and partnerships.

üìç The EU's reaction reflects broader global efforts to regulate AI and ensure competitive markets.

üëâ Market Insights:

üìç The EU's stringent stance on AI regulation and competition may impact how tech giants engage with startups.

üìç Microsoft's investment model, avoiding initial equity for future conversion, could face regulatory challenges.

üëâ Expert Statement:

üó®Ô∏è Brando Benefei, MEP: Criticizes Mistral's lobbying efforts, underscoring the importance of not diluting AI safety regulations amidst powerful corporate lobbying.

üëâ Impact & Recommendations:

üìç This development could influence future EU policies on AI and tech investments.

üìç Observers should watch for outcomes of regulatory reviews and potential implications for the AI industry.

1762118276388421809,2024-02-26 14:11:50+00:00,"Warren Buffett‚Äôs warning on the state of things today in the stock market - the widely prevalent casino-like culture. Worth reading and reflecting upon. It‚Äôs a quick masterclass on avoiding permanent loss of capital.

* * *

""Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can ‚Äì and will ‚Äì unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won‚Äôt happen often ‚Äì but they will happen.

...Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today‚Äôs active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. 

For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.

One fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street ‚Äì to use the term in its figurative sense ‚Äì would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens‚Äô juices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be vigorously marketed ‚Äì not by everyone but always by someone.

Occasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant perpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes bewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful. Money, he learns, has trumped morality.

One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been ‚Äì and will be ‚Äì rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes.""

At its core, Tesla epitomizes boundless innovation - slashing costs as they revolutionize manufacturing for a new automotive era. Elon has earned our patience as they upgrade factories to potentially double margins in coming years.  

Consider Tesla's triumph dominating the EV space despite young age and lean teams. Now they assemble a global gigafactory empire while newcomers struggle for relevance. $TSLA definies odds repeatedly with otherworldly execution!

And we've merely scratched the surface of vehicles, solar, batteries and Elon's master plan. Let short-sighted types fixate on market fluctuations. With room for 50% yearly earnings growth ahead, buying Tesla near $200 per share will prove genius in hindsight.

So while I too applaud $NVDA seizing the AI crown, true visionaries know one king cannot rule every realm. The age of electrification beckons titanic fortunes with Tesla leading the charge.

1678613828420894721,2023-07-11 03:54:58+00:00,"READ ALL BELOW: Lets do a deeper dive in $SNOW & $MDB & how software solutions like MongoDB & Snowflake can serve as backbone platforms for managing and processing data in AI applications. These platforms provide robust infrastructure, scalability, and advanced features that are essential for handling and analyzing large volumes of data. LIKE & RETWEET IF YOU ENJOY THIS!

Remember, ML, LLM, data optimization & proprietary data sets.  If you need a refresher what this is, please start at my original post below.  In the AI space, both relational and non-relational databases have their place. Relational databases may be used for structured data storage, maintaining data consistency, and handling complex relationships. Non-relational databases are often employed for managing large-scale unstructured and semi-structured data, enabling scalability, and providing flexibility in data modeling. 
Lets get techy & dive deeper!

Relational Databases such as Snowflake:

Structured Data: Relational databases are good  at handling structured data with well-defined schemas. They are optimized for storing and querying structured data with strong data consistency and integrity. This makes them suitable for scenarios where structured data is prevalent, such as transactional systems, financial data, or traditional business applications.

Complex Relationships: Relational databases are designed to handle complex relationships between different entities. They utilize joins and foreign key constraints to establish relationships and enforce data integrity. This can be valuable in AI applications that involve complex data models or require deep analysis of interrelated entities.

Non-Relational Databases such as MDB(NoSQL):

Scalability and Flexibility: Non-relational databases offer high scalability and flexibility. They are designed to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. NoSQL databases can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple nodes, making them suitable for big data and high-velocity data scenarios often encountered in AI applications.

Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases, provide flexibility in data modeling. They allow for dynamic schemas, accommodating evolving data structures without the need for schema modifications. This is huge in AI applications where data schemas can change frequently or have a variety of data types.

AI applications typically involve diverse data sources, including structured and unstructured data. The choice of database depends on factors such as data complexity, data volume, data relationships, scalability requirements, and the specific goals of the AI project. Hybrid approaches that combine both relational and non-relational databases can also be used to leverage the strengths of each for different aspects of an AI system.

MongoDB $MDB customers will benefit in several ways:

1) Data Management and Analytics: AI can enhance the capabilities of MongoDB's data management and analytics platforms. By leveraging AI techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing, MongoDB can improve data processing, analysis, and query optimization. AI can help in identifying patterns, making predictions, and generating insights from large datasets, enabling better decision-making for businesses.  Example of MDB current customers that can benefit from this would be $UBER & $LYFT Via True Intelligent Dispatch

2) Intelligent Automation: AI can enable MongoDB to develop intelligent automation solutions. For example, AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants can be built on top of MongoDB's platform to provide enhanced customer support and automate routine tasks. AI can also be used to automate data integration and data cleansing processes, improving data quality and efficiency.  This would be a significant improvement of current chatbot solutions as it will continue to auto enhance itself.

3) Personalization and Recommendation Engines: AI can enable MongoDB to build advanced personalization and recommendation engines. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, MongoDB can leverage AI algorithms to deliver personalized content, product recommendations, or tailored user experiences, increasing customer engagement and satisfaction.  This can bring online advertising on another level.

What is Snowflake known for?  How can $SNOW Snowflake customers benefit?

Snowflake is known for its scalability and performance in handling large-scale data processing and analytics workloads. It is designed to handle massive volumes of structured and semi-structured data and provides a cloud-based architecture that enables elastic scalability.

When it comes to scalability, Snowflake's architecture allows for seamless scaling up or down of compute resources based on workload demands. It leverages a separation of storage and compute, enabling organizations to scale compute independently of storage. This flexibility allows users to dynamically allocate resources to handle varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance even with large and complex datasets.

In terms of speed, Snowflake is designed to deliver fast query performance by utilizing distributed processing and query optimization techniques.  This is one of the reasons $NVDA is partnering with SNOW. Its architecture enables parallel execution of queries across multiple compute nodes, enabling efficient processing and analysis of large datasets. Snowflake also utilizes columnar storage and indexing for optimized data retrieval, reducing query response times.

Snowflake's cloud-native design takes advantage of the scalability and performance capabilities of cloud infrastructure providers such as $AMZN AWS, $MSFT Azure, $ORCL $IBM and more. By leveraging their underlying infrastructure, Snowflake can scale compute resources on-demand to handle high-volume workloads and provide fast data processing capabilities.  Snowflake also offers features like caching, query optimization, and automatic query parallelism to further enhance speed and performance. Snowflake has built-in data sharing capabilities allow organizations to securely share and collaborate on data across different entities, enabling efficient data processing and analysis.  THIS IS HUGE!!

1) Scalable Machine Learning: Snowflake's scalable architecture can be leveraged to train and deploy machine learning models at scale. Snowflake can provide a robust infrastructure for processing large datasets, training models, and deploying AI-powered applications or services.

2) Data Analytics and Insights: AI can enhance Snowflake's data analytics capabilities by enabling advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection. Snowflake's data warehouse platform combined with AI techniques can unlock valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data.

3) Data Governance and Security: AI can help Snowflake in implementing intelligent data governance and security measures. AI-powered algorithms can analyze data access patterns, detect anomalies or potential security breaches, and provide real-time alerts and automated responses to ensure data integrity and compliance.

When it comes to scalability, Snowflake's architecture allows for seamless scaling up or down of compute resources based on workload demands. It leverages a separation of storage and compute, enabling organizations to scale compute independently of storage. This flexibility allows users to dynamically allocate resources to handle varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance even with large and complex datasets.

In terms of speed, Snowflake is designed to deliver fast query performance by utilizing distributed processing and query optimization techniques. Its architecture enables parallel execution of queries across multiple compute nodes, enabling efficient processing and analysis of large datasets. Snowflake also utilizes columnar storage and indexing for optimized data retrieval, reducing query response times.

Using NVIDIA devices, Lets use $TSLA as an example to better understand how they can benefit from MDB and/or Snowflake. Here are some considerations for each:

Snowflake:

Scalability and Performance: Snowflake excels in handling large-scale data processing and analytics workloads. For example If $TSLA has significant amounts of structured and semi-structured data, and requires fast query performance and scalability, Snowflake can be a suitable choice.

Data Integration: Snowflake provides robust integration capabilities with various data sources and tools, making it easier to ingest and process data from multiple systems. If Tesla needs to integrate data from different sources or perform complex data transformations, Snowflake's ecosystem and integration capabilities can be advantageous.

Collaboration and Data Sharing: Snowflake offers built-in data sharing capabilities, allowing Tesla to securely share data with partners, suppliers, or other entities. This can be beneficial for collaborative data analysis and sharing insights within the organization's ecosystem.

MongoDB:

Flexibility and Agility: MongoDB's document-oriented nature allows for flexible and dynamic data modeling, making it suitable for handling unstructured or rapidly changing data. If Tesla requires the ability to store and retrieve diverse data types and adapt to evolving data schemas, MongoDB can provide greater flexibility.

Real-time Data Processing: MongoDB's capabilities, such as change streams and real-time data processing, make it a good fit for use cases requiring real-time data ingestion, processing, and analysis. If Tesla deals with streaming data or needs to react to data changes in real-time, MongoDB's features can be advantageous.

Developer-Friendly Environment: MongoDB's developer-friendly approach and extensive community support make it appealing for organizations that prioritize ease of development and rapid iteration. If Tesla's use cases involve agile development, prototyping, and quick iterations, MongoDB's ecosystem and community resources can be valuable.

Ultimately, the choice between Snowflake and MongoDB for Tesla would depend on the specific requirements, data characteristics, and use cases involved. It may be beneficial for Tesla to evaluate the data needs, workload characteristics, and integration requirements to determine which database aligns better with their overall data management and analytics strategy.

My kids and I love my PS5

But the reality is that consoles will go the way of the ‚Äúpalm pilot‚Äù

The future for the console, like it was for the DVD player, is obsolescence 

It used to be that the graphics processors, GPU‚Äôs in these consoles were more superior than a downloaded game in an app

As every major CSP (cloud service provider) rebuilds their data centers with NVDA AI GPU‚Äôs and many of AMD and their own AI chips, will be able to provide even a better video game streaming experience than any console because of the sheer level of computing power these data centers will have as they all become super computers 

Video game and ‚Äúinteractive media‚Äù is the next media evolution and revolution in ways that will transform every movie and gaming experience. It will be rare to watch a movie soon that you can‚Äôt interact with in someway that changes the story and the endings based on interactions

The world of gaming and movie making are about to change in profound ways

1762467165280546840,2024-02-27 13:18:11+00:00,"The story of how $NVDA became a $2T behemoth began 20 yrs ago with an unsolicited email from a Stanford researcher.

As the apocryphal story is told by CEO Huang himself, the Stanford quantum chemistry researcher wanted to personally thank Huang for making his life‚Äôs work achievable in his lifetime. Despite having access to the super computers of the worlds number one computer science university, the researcher was struggling to find the computational power required to model the molecules he was researching. Seeing his dad‚Äôs frustration, the researcher‚Äôs son ‚Äì a gamer, suggested the researcher go to the local electronics store to buy a bunch of off-the-shelf Nvidia GeForce graphics cards to try running the model on the graphics card for faster processing. The researcher ported his models onto the GeForce cards and was able to finish computing one model in a couple of hours, rather than the weeks it would have taken on Standford‚Äôs best super computers at the time. It turned out that Nvidia‚Äôs Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) parallel high intensity computing capability, which rendered stunning 3D graphics for the world‚Äôs most popular video games, was exactly what deep learning AI type models needed and weren‚Äôt getting from the more limited CPU sequential computing model.    

Thus began Nvidia‚Äôs journey to go from being good at making commodity graphic cards to now owning the most in-demand computer chip that powers the world‚Äôs data centers, enables self-driving cars, and trains the most powerful AI models. It also led to Nvidia growing from a $20 billion valuation at the height of its graphics niche business to its current $1.2 trillion valuation.  

While #Nvidia may have stumbled into a new market on the back of its primary competency of making GPU‚Äôs, it tapped into the powerful concept of optionality that leads to multiples (e.g., P/S, P/E) expansion and subsequent stock price increases.",6,0,"Toronto, Ontario"

WSJ:

So valuable is access to Nvidia‚Äôs chips that some customers are fearful of being punished for dealing with the company‚Äôs competitors. Jonathan Ross, CEO of chip-startup Groq, said that fear was palpable among customers who wanted alternatives but were wary of poking the beast.
‚ÄúA lot of people that we meet with say that if Nvidia were to hear that we were meeting, they would disavow it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe problem is you have to pay Nvidia a year in advance, and you may get your hardware in a year or it may take longer, and it‚Äôs, ‚ÄòAw shucks, you‚Äôre buying from someone else and I guess it‚Äôs going to take a little longer.‚Äô‚Äù 

The next frontier:

Huang‚Äôs life has changed along with Nvidia‚Äôs growth. He is driven around in a black Mercedes EQS electric car‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt drive himself any more, he says, for security reasons. 

One of his long-term focuses outside of AI is the notion that his chips could help in drug discovery and computational biology. He usually brings it up when asked what he‚Äôs most excited about in the future. Nvidia has invested in it, too, including a $50 million stake in drug-discovery startup Recursion last year.
To many of the chip-industry people he interacts with, it‚Äôs much like AI might have been a decade ago: a far-off possibility with a limited market for now, one of what Huang dubs his ‚Äúzero-billion dollar markets.‚Äù
 
In January, he had a discussion at a J.P. Morgan healthcare conference with the chairman of Recursion in which he discussed cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and structure prediction‚Äîall arcane industry terms.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to show off, but what other chip CEO would talk like that?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlong the entire pipeline of the discovery of drugs and medicine, we have algorithms and we have mathematics and we have expertise that we can be a partner to you, so please do reach out to us.‚Äù

Getting into new industries like AI early on, Huang says, gives him more time to figure out complex problems. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not very fast, but I‚Äôm very persistent,‚Äù he told a Chinese semiconductor professionals group recently. ‚ÄúI work on something for a very long time. So it allows me, if I choose problems and our company chooses problems that are very hard to do, we have a long time to work on them.‚Äù",10,1,

With a YTD surge of nearly 7% in the S&P 500, fundamental growth is crucial. Investors are banking on anticipated future earnings growth.

The recent upswing, fueled by Nvidia‚Äôs $NVDA strong earnings, raises concerns over S&P 500 valuations.

‚ÄúWe remain confident but need to recognize that much has been priced in. While the index may overshoot our year-end $5100 target, it seems premature to increase the probability of our $5700 bull case scenario,‚Äù said Citi strategists.

They also note that today's valuation multiples are significantly lower than those seen in 1999-2000.

‚ÄúThat said, the current spending ramp on gen AI infrastructure and product will need to translate to incremental revenue and growth drivers. But it is premature to judge that,‚Äù they added.

Citi emphasizes market broadening as crucial for reaching new index peaks.

‚ÄúPEG ratios support a broadening thesis. However, we‚Äôre still left with a valuation near the high end of longer-term averages,‚Äù they wrote.

1762414961278489036,2024-02-27 09:50:45+00:00,"Citi reports seeing ""Bullish investor sentiment 'nearly everywhere.'"" 

They highlight the strong consensus for bullish positions across global equity markets, with sentiment in nearly all surveyed markets above the 85th percentile. 

This has led to one-sided market dynamics, with shorts ""entirely unwound"" and most positions net long. 

The S&P and Nasdaq exhibit strong bullish trends, the latter at the 99th percentile despite varied ETF flows. Europe's DAX shows significant bullish positioning, cautioning against potential profit-taking. 

In Asia, Nikkei's long positions have seen an average profit of 12%, with China's A50 gaining momentum.

üö® $NVDA - THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?üö®

As I write, $NVDA is up 8.56% in After Hours trading after releasing their ""monster"" Q4-23 results. Compared to the Q3-23 report, there isn't much change in all the red flags üö©¬†I highlighted before [Post Below], but while I was comparing the two, my eye caught something strange.

Before I go forward, in case you don‚Äôt know, I would like to flag that $NVDA's Q4 is shifted 1 month forward compared to the majority of listed companies. Hence, it runs from the 1st of November till the end of January of the next year.

Alright, time to grab your üçø¬†now.

1 - In the last report, $NVDA declared that they repurchased a total of 21m shares, paying $9.7bn throughout their latest fiscal year. What‚Äôs interesting about this? Unusually, since companies always report shares bought in the quarter and in YTD in intermediate earnings reports, $NVDA doesn‚Äôt mention how many shares were bought back during the last quarter üö©¬†(Picture 1).

Odd, isn‚Äôt it? ü§î

2 - Alright, Jensen, let‚Äôs go figure this out. As we can see in Picture 2 from the Q3-23 report, up until the last quarter, $NVDA repurchased 15.9m shares, paying $7.01bn. Applying some quick math, we can figure out $NVDA bought back 5.1m shares in the last quarter, paying $2.69bn. Alright, what‚Äôs wrong with this?

üî´¬†üí®- Applying some easy math again, we can quickly figure out that the average price $NVDA paid in Q4 was $527. Do you know what was the average price of $NVDA shares during Q4 overall? As a simple average, $492; as an average weighted by the trading volumes, $502.

In the Q3-23 report, $NVDA kindly provided us with an extra piece of information: ""From October 30, 2023, through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8m shares for $366m pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.""

Alright, that means that in the first ~20% of the quarter, $NVDA repurchased ~20% of the shares. Nothing uncommon here. It's actually pretty normal for companies to run buybacks at regular schedules. Otherwise, they might easily breach SEC insider trading rules if caught in actively manipulating their #stocks prices üòÖ

Considering what I said, $NVDA should then continue its share buyback program regularly for the remaining 80% of the quarter, right?

Now, if we exclude the 800k shares repurchased for $366m, then $NVDA would have been left with 4.3m shares to repurchase for $2.324bn, right? That means the average price for that buyback is $540.47. What was $NVDA's average price between November 17, 2023, and January 29, 2024? $510.9 the simple average, or $513.7 the volume-weighted average.

üö© Putting it all together, $NVDA overpaid ~6.9% to repurchase its own shares in Q4, equivalent to $187m. Now, please have a look at the line ""Unsettled Share Repurchases"" in Picture 3. What‚Äôs the amount? $187m!

Now, as everyone familiar with buybacks knows, shares repurchased are settled immediately through your custodian. What about call options though? Well‚Ä¶ that actually fits in the category of ""Unsettled Share Repurchases""! üòâ

I will end with a question: What do you think are the chances $NVDA is overpaying its #stocks buybacks so someone else can, on their behalf, use that money to play the OTM call options gamma squeeze game on $NVDA stock?

NOTES:
- Chips dominating inside day scan
- $SPY looks to be in a descending channel. Upside needs 507.20, downside needs 505.86
- $QQQ looks to be breaking wedge down on 65m. Would be careful though, not perfect. 436.66 is the level to hold to invalidate downside
- $IWM finished bear gap fill from Friday
- $AAPL kind of looking like a h&s formation on 65m and daily with neckline roughly at 180. If that's lost no playing the upside. Not great at spotting h&s patterns so if someone could confirm that would be helpful
- $MSFT began filling the island bottom with an intraday wedge break. Full fill is at 402.33. I wouldn't play the downside until that's filled, and upside only if 409.19 is recaptured 
- $NVDA with a TL formed on 65m. If that breaks to the downside it's 774-775.42 zone. Below that can revisit double island bottom around 744
- $GOOGL with lots of sell volume. Formed an island top starting at 142.45 and fill at 142.80. Full bear gap fill at 143.95. No plays to the upside tomorrow with a longer term TL break down in the 140 area intraday. IF it loses 137.40 can expect bull gap target below from 135.72-136.27
- $NFLX look for break above 590 for calls but anything below 586.22 stay away for now. Bull gap open from 573.28-578.74
- $TSLA strong today closing a bear gap and flagging below 202.07. Breaking can see bear gap test and possibly fill from 203.17-207.76
- $AMD lots of compression operating within a 1 point range after open. Support at 175.96, resistance at 177.24. Can take the upside with 177.91 break and hold, downside with TL loss from 65m and 175.34 loss. Targets to the upside are 180 and 182, downside are 173.20 and 171.72

After reporting blow off quarter, Nvdia went up toward upper end of Bollinger Band and created topping tail $823.94 last Friday.

Since then, momentum has weakened and now its creating symmetric triangle which could go either way

There are near term peak volume support (a) $800 and (b) $775 supporting current price level

Breaking below peak volume (b) potentially testing support (1) or peak volume (c) $730-$740

If it failed to defend support (1) or peak volume (c), then potential downside on peak volume (d) where price level prior to earning report.

Breaking above topping tail $823.94 will push toward all times high!

Beautiful breakout by NVDIA this morning. 

Feb 12th topping tail has been invalidated and it broke above resistance (1). Now we just need to monitor if it could close above resistance (1) today to turn this level into support.

RSI is breaking out followed by MACD momentum reversing.

Based on my reading, today up volume (2) 5.7 million+ (3.8 times avg. 200MA volume) is the highest volume ever for Nvdia in 4H chart. Anyone can correct me if I'm wrong.  This is really impressive !

As long as it is above resistance(1), then momentum should be to the upside and targeting $800 price level of top-end Bollinger Band 3 Std. Deviation 

Breaking below resistance (1), then there is peak volume support around $680 which should act as a buyer zone.

We are currently at temp. tiny peak volume which could acts as a small rejection, but once we get through this hurdle, then $800 becomes a reality.

Good news for AGI:

5 things you should know about High NA EUV lithography that ASML is transitioning to:

During High NA lithography, the rate at which imaging data flows from the chip pattern to the wafer is equal to streaming 100 movies per second. 

The new platform, known as EXE, offers chipmakers a CD of 8 nm. That means they can print transistors 1.7 times smaller ‚Äì and therefore achieve transistor densities 2.9 times higher ‚Äì than they can with NXE systems.

1. High NA EUV for sharper imaging ‚Äî The ‚ÄòNA‚Äô in the name refers to numerical aperture ‚Äì a measure of the ability of an optical system to collect and focus light. 

The higher NA is what gives the systems their better resolution

2. Faster stages for higher productivity‚Äî

EXE‚Äôs stage accelerates four times faster than the previous system called NXE‚Äôs ‚Äî the equivalent of a race car going from 0 to 100 km/h in 0.09 seconds. 

ASML has targets to increase productivity to 220 wafers per hour in 2025.

3. Simplify manufacturing for cost efficiency: 
High NA EUV lithography will enable chipmakers to print the smallest features on the most advanced microchips but at optimized cost.

4. Commonality and modularity for better performance:

The quick timeline is good news especially for AI Chip developers.
The sooner these systems start printing state-of-the-art chips, the sooner the cutting-edge technology they enable will be available.

5. Improved chip functionality, performance and energy efficiency: 

The 8 nm resolution of the EXE:5000 means that chipmakers can pack more transistors into a single chip.
Smaller transistors are more energy efficient ‚Äì that means the chips will be able to do more with less",0,0,"Omaha, NE"

Positive on near-term momentum for NVDA and end-market growth, but also highlights AMD is entering the picture and market wants a second source.  Pretty positive on AMD first AI GPU.

Highlights
-Every hyperscaler relies on NVDA, rolling out AMD, and working on internal chip
-See both 1) models getting larger and larger, and 2) more focus on fine-tuning mid-sized models (1b parameters)
-GPUs last for 5 years, after that are done

NVDA
-NVDA CUDA sw is phenomenal w/ excellent support
-H100 used mostly for training while A100 mostly used for inference
-Next high-end addition will be H200 for most demanding customers
-Notorious for extracting price ‚Äì will charge double if need product in a month vs in six months [supports worry that NVDA over-earnings]

AMD
-MI300 has good performance / dollar and higher bandwidth from more memory which will be their edge
-NVDA will counter w/ more memory after H100 series
-Large scale volume purchases of MI300 just started for most hyperscalers this qtr
-Performance / dollar is the metric and AMD probably 20-25% less than NVDA but chip not going to work for high-end applications w/ infiniband, etc. etc.
-Chip will work for decent LLM, not a very big LLM
-Highly confident first offering is actually very good ‚Äì great start for them.
-Challenge is the ROCm software which is unpopular ‚Äì positive being open source ‚Äì couple years away from catching up w/ NVDA
-Believe AMD could get 20% share of market in 8 months; 40% share could take a few years but NVDA share loss bound to happen ‚Äì customers will diversify
-AMD CPU performance / cost is better than INTC ‚Äì still lots of market that pay the premium for known brand

Future?
-NVDA keeps market share for next 6-12 months
-Magic for AMD as far as market share potentially happens in year 2 but not in year 1.  Need hyperscalers to get it, test out hw / sw, get customers comfortable, etc.
-NVDA will remain leader but 95% share might drop to 55-60% over time",44,6,NYC

1762218522602504672,2024-02-26 20:50:10+00:00,"Interesting juncture here for $TSLA : $NVDA relative pair as it trades back to the low end of the range, coming close to tapping -2.8SD of the 50WMA and the 50 week bands are starting to expand.
With the breakout to new ATHs in $SPX, I looked back at the RCA chart of 1925-1929 to see if I could find anything in a similar setup.

RCA in the 1920s had a big tailwind of Radio adoption. When I look at $TSLA, it has had a similar 3 year consolidation (2021-2024) to that of RCA (1924-1927), and the adoption of EVs is at a similar stage of the adoption curve as radios in 1927 (5-10% of households). Below is what the overlay would look like if $TSLA follows the RCA move of the late 1920s (it pained me to make this non-log btw, but I did it to illustrate a point).

Outside of the perma bull fanboys on here, the penetration of the stock in portfolios never really got to excessive positioning. It's not a stock that Financial Advisors are recommending to their clients. They'd get laughed at. There are more analyst sell ratings on $TSLA than the top 10 Chinese stock names combined. $TSLA is also not a top 50 HF position, leaving a lot of room for momentum chasers to jump in when the stock breaks out. It is also the most shorted stock in the market by shares.

Another catalyst to get the shares going will be the Optimus bot and Energy businesses. Energy is ramping, and will take a few years to hit its full stride, and Optimus likely will produce something later this decade that gets the ball rolling. The stock has historically run AHEAD of business delivery in what appears to be pure speculation. $TSLA ran ahead of hitting profitability in 2020.

Once we see some momentum coming into the Bot iterations, Wall St will likely become excited about the TAM and momentum in the stock will truly hit. Once we hit that truly extended valuation, it'll be a peak that we won't see again for a decade, if at all. It'll spend the rest of its time growing into that valuation and from that point forward it'll be a value trap similar to what we saw in $INTC and $CSCO. I.e. ""Look at how cheap it trades! At this rate it'll buy back all of the float in 5 years! It has to go higher! No brainer.""

There is a reason that the stock hasn't traded down to it's ""true"" valuation, and it's because it has unfinished business on the upside.",14,1,Here

This is consistent with my thesis of the $SPX rally topping out in the 5100-5200 range, followed by a larger, healthy, correction into early Q2 

Basically, this uptick in recent vol positioning by participants signals a nuanced trade approach, where the longer-dated calls on the $VIX serve as either a hedge or directional bet against anticipated market volatility in the future (Q2 in this case) 

At the same time, the short-term $VIX puts reflect either a hedge or directional bet for more $SPX ST upside in case the market pushes towards the high-end of my topping range (~5200)

Participants are reaching for long-vol right now, per the image from my BBG account below, with the expectation that volatility recently bottomed in the 12-13 range

This is a classic sign of the trend changing ‚Äòunder-the-hood‚Äô before it becomes visible in price

That acquisition is now responsible for maybe 80% of that value (read the attached 2019 press release to get a sense of why). It reminds me of when Activision bought Call of Duty maker Infinity Ward for $5M and gained billions on that game to become the world‚Äôs largest video game company. Except the NVIDIA acquisition is making them a contender for the world‚Äôs biggest company.

I made a ton of money on that acquisition, but I didn‚Äôt reinvest those big gains into NVDA. I don‚Äôt know if Eyal Waldman, the CEO and co-founder of that Israeli company Mellanox, whose innovations are now moving mountains, and who was a proponent of peace hiring Palestinians‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if he reinvested his gains into $NVDA. He probably didn‚Äôt. But it doesn‚Äôt matter when you consider the context... no amount of money could possibly replace losing his daughter at that festival massacre in Israel.

While this investment game is full of shock and drama and savvy and envy and luck with people and companies making amazing decisions and others totally missing out or selling out too soon, the losses and rewards, the victories and suffering, are only as important as we pretend they are. In reality, we‚Äôre all just a bunch of privileged people benefiting from the overall riches of first world life and all this extra money and investment is just a game that we shouldn‚Äôt ever forget we‚Äôd instantly trade for health, for love, for getting back years, or for getting back a life.

Current Stock Price - $802.50

***I have no position in Nvidia. I am long $SMCI from the $200s***

Price Targets (1-3 year time frame):
Bull Case - $3,406.82
Base Case - $2,192.89
Bear Case ‚Äì $1,402.11

My price targets are based on discounting future cash flows.

There is no better company in the stock market than Nvidia. It is the right company at the right time. The AI revolution is still in the early days and Nvidia is primed to ride this wave to much higher levels. This is not crypto or web3 or the metaverse. AI is real and all companies from all industries are discussing how AI can benefit them.

Growth Rates from Most Recent Year End:
-  Revenue ‚Äì 126%
-  Operating Income ‚Äì 681%
-  EPS ‚Äì 586%

Key Metrics:
-  Current P/E ‚Äì 67.19
-  ROE ‚Äì 91.46% (2024) vs 17.93% (2023)
-  Gross Margin ‚Äì 72.72% (2024) vs 56.93% (2023)
-  Profit Margin ‚Äì 91.46% (2024) vs 17.93% (2023)

For a company valued at just short of $2 trillion these are the numbers you want to see and based on the earnings call, there is not going to be too much of a slowdown.

It all starts with Data Center. Revenue for Data Center was up more than triple to $47.5 billion. This comprised nearly 78% of all Nvidia‚Äôs revenue. As the company said during the earnings call, we are at a tipping point of a brand-new computing era. The current $1 trillion installed base will be transitioning rapidly from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. Companies are building out the next generation of modern data centers. The company refers to this as AI factories. Taking directly from the earnings call transcript, revenue growth was ‚Äúdriven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year.‚Äù

Nvidia is seeing growth across all areas including both training and inference of generative AI as well as large language models (LLMs) across all industries. What sets Nvidia apart from others is CUDA, which is a parallel computing platform and programming model for general computing on GPUs. Developers can dramatically speed up computing applicating. Nvidia‚Äôs compute allows companies to deploy multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategies by extending seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments.

On the earnings call Nvidia mentions many large companies including, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Google, Antrhopic, Inflection, OpenAI, X, and brings up car companies which includes Tesla the leader in EV and autonomous driving. All companies are scrambling to get as many Nvidia GPUs as they can. The company continues to point out that demand far exceeds supply. At this point in time, it is hard to imagine anything slowing down Nvidia (besides a massive recession). There is increased competition coming from AMD and Intel but they are so far behind. China is a headwind as the United States banned Nvida‚Äôs highest end GPUs from being shipped to Chinese companies. The company is still shipping GPUs but that does open the door for Chinese companies to take market share in China.

Conclusion:

Nvidia does not have much in its way to stop the rampant growth the company is seeing. Investors can expect similar growth rates going forward as the company keeps saying demand is far exceeding supply. If you are thinking about adding Nvidia to your portfolio, I highly recommend reading the latest earnings call transcript. It contains tons of information and question and answer with the executives of Nvidia. I do not have a position in Nvidia (I am long Super Micro Computers (SMCI) from the $200s) but if I had to buy one company out of the large tech stocks (i.e Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Tesla, etc.) I would choose Nvidia. The only company over the next few years that I believe can compete with Nvidia with high growth rates is Tesla. Nvidia is the champ for now. I would not be surprised to see this company become the largest in the world by market cap.

Walmart $WMT is one of the world's largest retail corporations, operating a vast network of discount department stores, hypermarkets, and grocery stores globally. 

The company generates revenue through a variety of channels, including the sale of general merchandise, groceries, apparel, electronics, home furnishings, and other consumer goods. 

Additionally, Walmart $WMT offers various services such as financial services, pharmacy, and digital services, contributing to its revenue stream.

$WMT's primary revenue driver is its extensive network of physical stores, which attract millions of customers worldwide. The company leverages economies of scale and efficient supply chain management to offer low prices to consumers, thereby driving sales volume. 

Furthermore, $WMT's e-commerce segment has experienced significant growth in recent years, bolstered by investments in digital infrastructure, acquisitions, and partnerships. 

The company's online platform serves as an essential complement to its brick-and-mortar presence, allowing customers to shop conveniently from home and access a wide range of products and services.

In the retail landscape, $WMT holds a dominant position as a market leader, renowned for its expansive product offerings, competitive pricing, and convenient shopping experience. 

The company's scale and reach give it a significant competitive advantage over rivals, enabling it to capture market share across various retail segments. Moreover, $WMT's strong brand recognition and customer loyalty further solidify its position in the industry.

In e-commerce, $WMT has been increasingly focused on expanding its digital footprint to compete with online giants like $AMZN. The company has made strategic investments in enhancing its e-commerce capabilities, including acquisitions like Jet and partnerships with tech companies to bolster its online presence. 

While $WMT initially lagged behind Amazon in the e-commerce space, its concerted efforts have led to significant growth in online sales, positioning it as a formidable competitor in the digital retail arena.

Regarding the recent stock split, $WMT announced a 3-for-1 stock split in February 2023. A stock split involves dividing each existing share into multiple shares, effectively reducing the price per share while increasing the total number of shares outstanding. 

Stock splits are primarily cosmetic in nature and do not affect the overall value of investors' holdings. However, they can make shares more accessible to a broader range of investors by lowering the share price, potentially increasing liquidity and trading activity.

For investors, the stock split may signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects and its commitment to shareholder value. 

While the split itself does not fundamentally change the company's financials or operations, it could attract more investors to the stock, potentially driving demand and pushing the share price higher over time. 

Additionally, the increased liquidity resulting from the split may enhance the stock's tradability, making it more attractive to investors seeking to buy or sell shares.",0,1,Check it out ‚Üí

Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett stand as two titans in the world of investing, each wielding distinct styles and philosophies that have garnered widespread attention and admiration. 

While their approaches to investing may differ in several aspects, both have achieved remarkable success in navigating the complexities of financial markets.

Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, has gained prominence in recent years for her innovative and forward-thinking investment strategies, particularly in the realm of disruptive technologies and innovative industries. 

Wood's investment style is characterized by her strong belief in the potential of transformative technologies to reshape entire industries and generate substantial returns for investors over the long term.

In contrast, Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, follows a more traditional value investing approach. Buffett's investment philosophy is grounded in the principles of value, patience, and long-term thinking. 

He seeks out companies with durable competitive advantages, strong management teams, and attractive long-term prospects, often holding these investments for years, if not decades.

While Wood and Buffett differ in their investment styles and preferences, there are certain commonalities between them. Both investors emphasize the importance of thorough research and analysis before making investment decisions. 

They also share a long-term perspective, preferring to invest in companies with sustainable competitive advantages and robust fundamentals. 

Additionally, both Wood and Buffett have demonstrated a willingness to go against the grain and invest in areas where they see significant potential, even if it means deviating from conventional wisdom.

In the post below, I've called out one stock in particular that both Wood and Buffett own. While Buffett has traditionally avoided the tech sector, there is one company in particular that he owns which touches e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, logistics, robotics, and more.

Check out my full investment memo below to see which #ArtificialIntelligence stock Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett share.",0,1,Check it out ‚Üí

US Stock Market Update: Close of the Last Trading Dayüìà üìâ

The US stock market saw mixed movements across significant indices in the latest trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a slight uptick, gaining 0.16% to close at 39,131.53 points. The S&P 500 also increased by a marginal 0.03%, finishing at 5,088.80 points. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index faced a decline, dropping 0.28% to end at 15,996.82 points.‚Äã

Summary:
üîπ Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slightly rose by 0.16%, adding 62.42 points to close at 39,131.53.

üîπ S&P 500 made a modest gain, up by 0.03% or 1.77 points, ending at 5,088.80.

üîπ Nasdaq Composite experienced a slight decline, falling by 0.28% or 44.80 points to 15,996.82.

üîπ Economic Growth Projections: The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker revised its fourth-quarter economic growth projections upwards to a 2.6% annualised rate, driven by positive surprises in recent economic data, including a 0.3% growth in November's retail sales‚Äã

Market Analysis:
This mixed close highlights the diverse investor reactions to current market conditions, with technology stocks experiencing some pressure, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble era, according to some analysts‚Äã

The US stock market's mixed performance reflects a cautious optimism among investors, with specific sectors like banking showing robust gains. Housing market adjustments and positive economic growth projections also contribute to the market's dynamics. The decline in mortgage rates signals potential relief and opportunities within the housing sector.

üåè Mixed Movements Across Asian Markets: Nikkei Rises While Hang Seng and SENSEX Dip Amid Global Cuesüåè

In recent trading sessions, the Asian stock markets have shown mixed movements, reflecting diverse factors influencing investor sentiment across the region.

Summary:
üîπ The Nikkei Index in Japan experienced a slight gain, closing up by 0.35%.

üîπ Conversely, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong moved in the opposite direction, recording a modest decline of 0.53%.

üîπ The S&P BSE SENSEX Index in India also decreased, falling by 0.39%.

Market Analysis:
China's Markets: Chinese shares have seen an uptick, particularly in the energy and brokerage sectors. This rise is partly attributed to regulatory measures to stabilise the market, such as restrictions on major institutional investors' ability to sell equity holdings at critical trading times.

Hong Kong's Performance: Despite a drop in the Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong's market was buoyed by strong earnings reports and positive sentiment stemming from Beijing's investor confidence initiatives. Notable gains were seen in the energy sector, with significant increases for major companies.

Japan's Nikkei Surge: The Nikkei Stock Average soared to a new high, driven by gains in chip-related stocks following Nvidia's robust quarterly results. The market focuses on economic data and its implications for monetary policy.

Indian Market Dynamics: Indian shares showed a mixed performance, with the technology and auto sectors leading the gains. However, banking stocks lagged, pulling down the overall index.

Nikkei 225 is currently + 0.35%, Hang Seng is presently - 0.53% and the NIFTY 50 - 0.45%üìà üìâ

$675M investment round in Figure AI, a company using #AI to make human-like robots to replace the 7m unfilled jobs in retail, factories and transportation. 

A few thoughts on why this is significant... 

1. It's rare to see ""these"" giants invest alongside each other. Each could have easily bought this company for $3B. But Figure AI saw a greater opportunity to have these guys as investors (clients forever), instead of being part of a walled garden. 

2. Figure AI is run by a Brett Adcock, smart 37 year-old with a background in agriculture and specialized job recruiting. It would have been easy for this young entrepreneur to take the money and run. But his goal (as stated in his bio) is to ""build Figure with a 30-year view to positively impact the future of humanity."" I suggest remembering this name... as #Zuckerberg was not able to attract this much institutional attention during the early days of Facebook. 

3. $AMZN is one of the most innovative companies in the world. It's now investing in human-like robots. Imagine what the world will look like (5, 10 years from now) if Figure AI gets this right?

 For years the SEC ignored @HarryMarkopolos's warnings about Bernie Madoff and so did the journalists he contacted to cover the story. Until they couldn't.  

It feels very much like the alarm bells we've been ringing about the Counterfeit shares  flooding our financial markets.  

These counterfeit shares  (naked shorts, phantom shares) have destroyed, are destroying or have the potential to destroy markets, companies, jobs, pensions, 401k's.. brokers, banks and hedge funds

No one can say they didn't know. 
Yet after 14 months $MMTLP can't get the certified aggregated, audit share count, a public hearing or even a subpoena issued to brokers or financial regulators to get the share count.

The restatement revealed that, as a result of the transaction described above, as originally reported, Nvidia's gross profit was overstated by 6.4%, net income by 15.3%, and diluted earnings per share by 14.8%

Gen AI is no doubt transformational.  

But it is not without challenges...

AI is Hungry | AI computing‚Äôs energy density and space needs exceed current hyperscale data center capabilities.¬† Energy demand for AI is projected to exceed the entire current data center levels.¬† Some estimates put it at 20-30GW. 5GW of demand in 2024 alone.

AI is Thirsty | Traditional data centers, particularly those utilized for AI, exhibit substantial water consumption.¬† Microsoft used an estimated equivalent of 2.8 Million glasses of water to train ChatGPT-3 due to the current cooling design of traditional data centers.

AI is Dirty | Traditional data centers are responsible for 2% of overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. GPT-3, Gopher, BLOOM, and OPT had more than 900 tonnes of carbon emissions.

Feels like another day to look #LONG, $NVDA back and marching towards $800 and will take it, #NASDAQ trying to hold 18k, if we do look out upside! 

$NVDA $805L/780L - dip support into $780, if we get that gift, its worth taking against possible $775.  I also like the break over $800 and look to hold that and smash the $805 top from Friday.  If this is what everyone wants to talk about, then lets trade it.    

$AMZN $175L - we tried this on Friday and it didnt hold, now we are through and holding? I want to trade this new #DOW component to the LONG side. 

$BABA $75L - #China still an issue, but this name had a good Q and should continue higher if we hold this $75 level.

$PLTR $22.50L - great level down here, and it has come off its #earnings high.  Should find a bid at some point, so take advantage of this. Will hold it down to around $22, should give it some room.  

$RIVN $10SS - Just momentum here, should try and test it and could be good for quick #SHORT scalp, but dont hold back through.

Possible Scenario: SHORT

Evidence:
The asset has moved outside of the Keltner channel on a monthly timeframe and is overbought across all timeframes. We are currently in the AI Bubble Era, with the economy facing potential challenges such as the possibility of a debt crash, a commercial real estate crash, or a regional banks crash, among others.

Target Prices:

TP1: $600
TP2: $400
TP3: $270
A 70 to 90 percent retracement is not an unusual scenario when a bubble bursts, similar to what occurred with many companies during the dot-com bubble.

Conclusion:
The stock market is at risk of collapsing due to the AI bubble.

Sometimes it's worth to pay attention to the tone of a research piece.

When I covered $NVDA's 1Q24 (https://t.co/IFlmXX6SVq) and 2Q24 (https://t.co/3LM7XviQOo) results last year, I was mildly bullish (albeit admittedly not enough to take a position).

If you reread those articles carefully you will notice that I sort of addressed them to a skeptical reader. I was almost embarrassed to say that the bull thesis appeared valid and had ramifications not just for the stock, but for the entire stock market.

Today, if I put in the time to articulate my view in an article, I would likely sound more cautious with an emphasis on underestimated cyclical risks. I would have a bullish reader in mind to whom I'd need to justify being skeptical. 

Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but I feel like NVIDIA consensus opinion has gone from short and skeptical to long and excited over the past 12 months. Interesting how the tides are shifting.

My point here is this: When you are developing a view on a stock, it helps if you feel a little bit embarrassed pitching it to someone else. It indicates that you are onto something.",4,0,"British Columbia, Canada"

Citi's Alex Saunders Stratagist emphasized that Nvidia's gains will continue for some time, although bubble concerns are growing amid a rally in Nvidia's stock price.   

""While Nvidia's steep rally is driving the entire IT sector, many investors are concerned that it is leading to an AI bubble. However, considering the trend of orders and sales growth of Nvidia and major AI companies, a sharp rise in stock prices is not necessarily a bubble,"" he said.   

""NVIDIA's daily market capitalization growth reached $277 billion, the highest ever, with its stock price soaring 16%. Historically, if the stock price of large-cap stocks rises more than 10% the day after the earnings announcement, the pattern of continuing its upward trend for the next three months also supports the prospect of Nvidia's upward trend,"" he said. 

""Strong earnings growth and steep rallies, as Nvidia is showing this time, are rare, and those cases are also concentrated during the dot-com bubble period. This is the basis for stimulating bubble risk, but it is also a data that strengthens Nvidia's confidence in rising stock prices, considering that gains of 27% were recorded for months at the time,"" he said.   

Furthermore, ""artificial intelligence technology is still in its infancy, and the market is still difficult to estimate. In history, it was not gold miners who made a lot of money during the gold rush, but rather shovels and pickers, and Nvidia will continue to generate huge profits because it belongs to this group.""",1,1,

1761957670192288077,2024-02-26 03:33:38+00:00,"Some more thoughts on $PLTR & $NVDA: 

Palantir got a small bump on $NVDA earnings by about 5%, and then lost that the next day. 

$NVDA continued to maintain their gains, and it seems like the street realized that what Jensen has been saying is true.

Now, why did the broader market rally off one stock doing well?

The way I see it, AI increases productivity, operating margins, and revenue for companies that implement it correctly. It also decreases costs.

This is important for public companies because if they decrease their costs and increase their revenues, their earnings should do better, and as a result, investors should buy their stocks.

So, seeing the entire market go up last week on $NVDA earnings was more of a testament to the confidence investors have that if GPU demand (read: AI demand) continues to surge, we eventually will see the increase in productivity at such a scale that every company, whether a healthcare company or logistics company, will get more efficient and produce better results.

Palantir sits in the middle of all those companies *actually implementing ai* and increasing revenue/decreasing costs.

Just because there is more data center demand does not mean there will just be companies increasing productivity ‚Äî software will be needed to operationalize the data those companies have (read: AIP) in order for those companies to figure out how to even begin streamlining their business processes and entering into the age of advanced data-driven decision making.

So, Nvidia is showing the market that there is massive demand for AI. 

Palantir $PLTR is set, in my opinion, to capitalize on that demand because companies will need something like an AIP+Foundry in order to implement software that makes AI real (increase revenue decreases costs) within their enterprise.

It‚Äôs a massive, massive market. 

Nvidia just showed us the market is only growing, and Palantir wants to be a big, big player in this market.",124,6,youtube ‚û°Ô∏è

Building more internet be-getted more demand for internet (theoretically) due to network effects. There are no network effects with GPUs. 

If you were the only one with internet fiber, it would be pointless because there would be nobody else to connect with you. GPUs are entirely self-contained. I'd be a billionaire if i was the only one in the world with GPUs.

The over built out of fiber optics laid down the infrastructure for ""cheap"" internet businesses down the road because they were expensive to build out initially but lasted a long time.

GPUs burn out around 4 years of intense use. You'll need to replace them down the road, unlike fiber.

‚ö†Ô∏èFEBRUARY 2020 ALL OVER AGAIN? üôà‚ö†Ô∏è

In 2020, stock markets in the #US and #Europe peaked on the 19th of February, while #China and #HongKong ones peaked exactly one month prior, on the 20th of January.

In a great twist of destiny, on the 21st of February this year, $NVDA is scheduled to report its Q4-23 financial results. It truly feels like #stocks will keep chasing their AI north star, no matter what happens prior to that.

$AMD, $MSFT, and other #fomo #stocks are set to report today after the bell, but frankly speaking, what's the point in commenting on numbers that we know in advance have been inflated (at a minimum), if not mostly fabricated (at the maximum)?

$AMD's market capitalization isn't as high as $NVDA's, only because they started fabricating their numbers at a later stage (booking as revenues the ""massive"" pre-orders popping up out of nowhere from phantom clients). üò¨

$MSFT, on the other hand, is a 3 trillion $USD market cap company that needed to fake a 10bn$ investment in #OpenAI to boost its revenue line. Yes, in case you missed it, $MSFT only invested ~1bn$ cash in #OpenAI, while the rest were all ""credits"" for #OpenAI to use $MSFT's Azure services (see the post below). Translated: $MSFT made up revenues in the same way a magician pulls a white üêá out of his üé©!

The $MSFT ""trick"" has been so clearly (ab)used by Silicon Valley that the US FTC authority just launched an inquiry into Generative AI Investments and Partnerships. (https://t.co/nXmltWUPBu). 

Why people pretended to be so surprised when this news hit last week, I am not sure. Months back, I literally wrote this during the #OpenAI drama: ""IT WILL NOW BE HARDER FOR THE REGULATOR TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO CORPORATE MALPRACTICES."" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Similar to February 2020, people living at the other end of the Silk Road or across the Pacific Ocean can't grasp the magnitude of the events unfolding in Asia. By allowing #Evergrande to fall into liquidation, the Chinese government made it clear that people's taxpayer money will be used to rescue taxpayer people in trouble, not reckless #stocks and #bonds speculators. 

Do you think this was ""priced in""? Of course not, and the fact that yesterday morning investors were still #BTFD into #Evergrande stock, in complete denial of what was happening, clearly proves that (https://t.co/EJceEQj6oc). üôÑ

This is the first tile to fall in a very long domino that will continue with names like Country Garden, Sunac, and Shimao, to end with big international banks and investors that, since 2008, have been buying China Real Estate developers debt as if there was no tomorrow, despite the near-death experience they just had with the implosion of the Subprime bubble in the US. As if this wasn't enough, the #CRE and Subprime Consumer Loans bubbles in the US are ready to pop at the same time today.

The cherry on the cake? The #FED just pulled away the #BTFP safety net from the system (https://t.co/jJs6N9MhD3) and is now telling banks they have to get their acts together ASAP because, in an election year, the political cost of a bailout will be too risky to handle for an already unpopular incumbent president seeking reelection. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",449,115,Hong Kong

üö® $NVDA - THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?üö®

As I write, $NVDA is up 8.56% in After Hours trading after releasing their ""monster"" Q4-23 results. Compared to the Q3-23 report, there isn't much change in all the red flags üö©¬†I highlighted before [Post Below], but while I was comparing the two, my eye caught something strange.

Before I go forward, in case you don‚Äôt know, I would like to flag that $NVDA's Q4 is shifted 1 month forward compared to the majority of listed companies. Hence, it runs from the 1st of November till the end of January of the next year.

Alright, time to grab your üçø¬†now.

1 - In the last report, $NVDA declared that they repurchased a total of 21m shares, paying $9.7bn throughout their latest fiscal year. What‚Äôs interesting about this? Unusually, since companies always report shares bought in the quarter and in YTD in intermediate earnings reports, $NVDA doesn‚Äôt mention how many shares were bought back during the last quarter üö©¬†(Picture 1).

Odd, isn‚Äôt it? ü§î

2 - Alright, Jensen, let‚Äôs go figure this out. As we can see in Picture 2 from the Q3-23 report, up until the last quarter, $NVDA repurchased 15.9m shares, paying $7.01bn. Applying some quick math, we can figure out $NVDA bought back 5.1m shares in the last quarter, paying $2.69bn. Alright, what‚Äôs wrong with this?

üî´¬†üí®- Applying some easy math again, we can quickly figure out that the average price $NVDA paid in Q4 was $527. Do you know what was the average price of $NVDA shares during Q4 overall? As a simple average, $492; as an average weighted by the trading volumes, $502.

In the Q3-23 report, $NVDA kindly provided us with an extra piece of information: ""From October 30, 2023, through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8m shares for $366m pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.""

Alright, that means that in the first ~20% of the quarter, $NVDA repurchased ~20% of the shares. Nothing uncommon here. It's actually pretty normal for companies to run buybacks at regular schedules. Otherwise, they might easily breach SEC insider trading rules if caught in actively manipulating their #stocks prices üòÖ

Considering what I said, $NVDA should then continue its share buyback program regularly for the remaining 80% of the quarter, right?

Now, if we exclude the 800k shares repurchased for $366m, then $NVDA would have been left with 4.3m shares to repurchase for $2.324bn, right? That means the average price for that buyback is $540.47. What was $NVDA's average price between November 17, 2023, and January 29, 2024? $510.9 the simple average, or $513.7 the volume-weighted average.

üö© Putting it all together, $NVDA overpaid ~6.9% to repurchase its own shares in Q4, equivalent to $187m. Now, please have a look at the line ""Unsettled Share Repurchases"" in Picture 3. What‚Äôs the amount? $187m!

Now, as everyone familiar with buybacks knows, shares repurchased are settled immediately through your custodian. What about call options though? Well‚Ä¶ that actually fits in the category of ""Unsettled Share Repurchases""! üòâ

I will end with a question: What do you think are the chances $NVDA is overpaying its #stocks buybacks so someone else can, on their behalf, use that money to play the OTM call options gamma squeeze game on $NVDA stock?

Also, I can somewhat mitigate the risk of shorting against an aggressive trend by taking shares of a 3x ETF, as I won't have to worry about other factors like Theta (the ETF decay rate is minimal in comparison)

1761912225701224461,2024-02-26 00:33:04+00:00,"Because street consensus for capex is too low‚Ä¶

Take $MSFT as an example:

- $35B total capex disclosed (excl. capital lease), of which
- $31B was spent on total datacenter capex (MS estimates), of which
- $11.6B was spent on GPUs (disclosed by $NVDA - No.1 end customer, 19% of total revenue)

The difference between the latter two figures ($31B and $11.6B) suggests a $20B capex primarily on construction and data center infrastructure.

Assuming capex for servers to infrastructure has a ratio of 3:1 for GPU data centers, this would imply that $MSFT will spend ~$60B on GPUs over the next ~12 months (it takes ~9-12 months to complete the infra buildout, before putting in servers/GPUs).

The street (which has $MSFT capex at $45-50B) can be 50% too low on the capex forecast.

It reminds me of when Activision bought Call of Duty maker Infinity Ward for $5M and gained billions on that game to become the world‚Äôs largest video game company. Except the NVIDIA acquisition is making them a contender for the world‚Äôs biggest company.

I made a ton of money on that acquisition, but I didn‚Äôt reinvest those big gains into NVDA. I don‚Äôt know if Eyal Waldman, the CEO and co-founder of that Israeli company Mellanox, whose innovations are now moving mountains, and who was a proponent of peace hiring Palestinians‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if he reinvested his gains into $NVDA. He probably didn‚Äôt. But it doesn‚Äôt matter when you consider the context... no amount of money could possibly replace losing his daughter at that festival massacre in Israel.

- Weekly RSI around 84 (most in the history of this name, has pulled back from 80-82 in the past)
- Daily RSI around 88 (again most ever) 
- Almost at a long term trendline resistance where it has always pulled back.

I understand the overbought can stay overbought for long time but those RSI levels require some cool down and hence the short theory. Imo this is a very good short opportunity.

Huayi is a cultural and high-tech enterprise that leads the operation of cinema chains, with advanced AI system technology at the core. 

If the merger is successful, $SPQS would become the parent operating company of the merging company. It states in the filing that the Chinese company is seeking advancement to the USA market through this partnership and by effecting a special purpose vehicle (SPV) which to me sounds similar to a spac that is used for IPO. 

The merging company boasts a $100M capitalization in China and a well seasoned management. 

To clarify, this is a speculative venture that is not yet finalized. The intention of the merger was presented in the filings. Remember this is not trade advice‚Ä¶. just sharing:)

It reminds me of when Activision bought Call of Duty maker Infinity Ward for $5M and gained billions on that game to become the world‚Äôs largest video game company. Except the NVIDIA acquisition is making them a contender for the world‚Äôs biggest company.

I made a ton of money on that acquisition, but I didn‚Äôt reinvest those big gains into NVDA.

He probably didn‚Äôt. But it doesn‚Äôt matter when you consider the context... no amount of money could possibly replace losing his daughter at that festival massacre in Israel.

Get access to an additional FREE webcast, as Hedgeye Director of Research @HedgeyeDJ welcomes Enrique Abeyta ‚ÄúIn the Arena‚Äù at 1pm ET on Thursday, February 28.

The founder and CEO of HX Research will share his thoughts on what to expect in the economy and U.S. stock markets.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs most interesting is potent signals support both bulls and bears,‚Äù @enriqueabeyta wrote in his latest newsletter. ‚ÄúHistorically, rates going up this quickly has resulted in economic problems and the stock market taking a tumble. On the other side, though, there are a host of equally powerful signals historically that argue that the stock market will have a good year.‚Äù

Like McCullough, Abeyta listens to data-based signals to inform his market outlooks. In this free webcast, Jones and Abeyta will provide investors insights on how to navigate market uncertainty in the economy for the remainder of 2024.

üçøClick here for more details on Thursday‚Äôs webcast: https://t.co/JPVPZjI1UA

‚ñ∂Ô∏èCheck out six high-conviction stocks picks from six of our analysts on The Pitch, a free webcast now available to watch anytime: https://t.co/MPyqzMSdxQ

You‚Äôre going to want to watch this. Veteran analyst @HedgeyeRetail pitched a long Retail stock pick for the first time in 18 months Thursday on The Pitch.

Here are some other highlights:

üìàFrom @HedgeyeIndstrls: ‚ÄúI think this is the kind of stock that can give you 40% upside without a ton of risk. This industry just consolidated a lot. This was more competition five years ago, and now you have two players that are really dominating the market.‚Äù

üìâFrom @HedgeyeSoftware: ‚ÄúThe company had success up-selling and cross-selling their workflows, which was primarily driven by the digital transformation of workflow in 2020, but this tailwind is now behind them. It‚Äôll be extremely hard for them to sustain this growth rate. The era of increase IT budgets during the pandemic is over.‚Äù

üìàFrom @Hedgeye_Staples: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre selling to such a wide spectrum of retailers. You can find them in natural stores, grocery stores, at the gym. You‚Äôd never see someone lifting weights and drinking a Monster, right? And you‚Äôd never buy Red Bull at GNC, but you can see this drink at all these places.‚Äù

The U.S. economy is filled with uncertainty, and as you can tell, we‚Äôve got our eyes trained on several stocks with significant upside and downside potential.

Join us Monday morning, and throughout Free All Access Week, as we share thorough research on how to preserve, protect and grow your hard-earned capital.",4,1,"Stamford, Connecticut"

""In the period of time from 2014 - 2020, the stock price didn't change very much through last summer. Our $219 stock was $230, $240, we made 10%, 20%, 30%. 

At the same period of time, the company's business ‚Äî we focus on business not stock prices ‚Äî the company's business had grown from $2.8 billion of annual revenues to $25 billion of annual revenues. 8 fold. So the company's up 8 fold, stock's up 20%, 10%.

Now what's happening ‚Äî this is just catch up. Now this year, Tesla is going to do somewhere around $32 billion in annual revenues and I guess that they're going to do $100 billion in annual revenues within 4 years. And I think they have potential for a trillion dollars of revenues by 2030.

The world of finance has gone bananas.

I rode the banana wave to peel back the trippy dangers of monoculture in the investment cosmos back in April 2012 when writing to my Eclectica clients. The idea was to highlight how a lack of diversity in strategies can leave the financial world vulnerable to systemic shocks.

Picture this: a lack of diversity in portfolios, like some wild disease wiping out a whole tribe of bananas. It's a cosmic parade, you know ? Howlin at the moon and searching for peyote. The risk of everyone grooving to the same beat, falling into the groupthink trap, everyone long the Magnificent 7.

In today's frenzied dance of the masses, where every investor holds hands with Nvidia, like it's the last ticket to the cosmic carnival, I see shades of the same madness of crowds. It's like everyone's chasing the same electric Kool-Aid, forgetting the wild beauty of individuality.

It's the groupthink boogie-man, where conformity strangles the adventurous soul. Kerouac would've said, ""The road of wisdom winds through the untrodden path, not the crowded boulevard.""

So, let's break free from the herd and find our own rhythm in this chaotic jazz of stocks. Navigate this financial freak show with our own wild, diverse strategies. Imagine this market as a smoky Joe's, dimly lit jazz club where each investment strategy is a distinct note, a unique instrument contributing to the ensemble.

Just as Chet weaves through melodies, you're allowed to harmonize and improvise, create your own rich, dynamic composition. Man, its the lost art of financial jazz, where the personal ¬†freedom to explore different beats and rhythms mitigates the risk of a one-note, rotten banana.

So, let your portfolio swing and groove, embrace the improvisational spirit of Chet's trumpet and concoct your very own mind-bending trip through the investment galaxy.

Otherwise we're all gonna go bananas...",319,20,Saint Barth√©lemy

$TSLA investors, there is an elephant in the room that no one is talking about. We have seen $NVDA break so many records, now a $2T valuation all based on datacenter GPU hardware to train AI models. 

Currently with about 80% margin, their growth and profitability is insane, but let‚Äôs not forget what Bezos said, ‚Äúyour margin is my opportunity ‚Äú and so the market will be rushing to make A100 competitors. 

Any likely candidates on that front? well there is AMD and ARM of course and things like Tensor and Groq, any others? Anyone think of an extremely well funded and very talented engineering team that have been working on proprietary massive AI compute for at least 3 years?

We know @elonmusk played it down on the last earnings call and it feels like it is still a long shot, but as @TeslaBoomerMama has flagged a few times, they are recruiting heavily for Dojo and it must have occurred to the Tesla team that if they could commercialize the Dojo ‚Äúchip‚Äù, Tesla could print additional money as fast as NVidia given the current demand for compute. 

There are a lot of ‚Äúifs‚Äù but imagine a world where out of the blue Tesla announce Dojo is production ready and not only will they be using it for FSD training, but also selling it as a competitor to NVidia, what does the market do with that info? I feel it would be pretty positive and would be a short term catalyst that could double the current stock price. All the focus is on bots and FSD, but Dojo fundamentally supports both those efforts, so it would make sense for Tesla to be really pushing that hard.

1761763954315981269,2024-02-25 14:43:53+00:00,"The AI crypto market exploded this month as the market cap doubled.

We saw Worldcoin gain 70%.

$RNDR and $AKR gained over 20% after $NVDA blew out earnings. 

But this is purely speculative. 

I took a closer look at how AI will intersect with crypto and the projects that are building in this space.

Specifically, I detail the enhanced functionalities that arise from the convergence of crypto and AI, outlining how these technologies intertwine to optimize efficiency for developers.

DeCompute

Corporations are initiating the buildout of LLMs and AI agents which has catalyzed substantial demand for compute. 

Of course, traditional chip suppliers such as Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Broadcom have all capitalized on this so far. 

But protocols that provide access to decentralized compute believe there is a secondary market that will form to fulfill this seemingly endless demand. 

DeCompute protocols create a network of compute owners that sublease their excess compute. This alternative solution can provide the GPUs which are needed for machine-learning training and model generation. 

Effectively, this solution not only provides a new method to train models but also unlocks new supply in which any entity with demanded compute can contribute to. 

(e.g.) @gensynai has capitalized on this solution as they aim to ‚Äúunite all of the world‚Äôs compute into a machine learning cluster.‚Äù 

This will be accomplished by harnessing excess compute from small data centers, retail users, and potentially small mobile devices. 

Other notable projects in this space include @akashnet_ @bittensor and @rendernetwork. 

zkML 

zk integrations present solutions for high compute costs that occur on blockchains as developers implement AI models into smart contracts. 

These benefits have also been noticed within security, efficiency, and UX. 

(e.g.) Developers using decompute models worrying that providers are using cheaper models can enable zkML to verify the validity of outputs. 

@ezklxyz is building verifiable proofs to verify on-chain execution and have demonstrated progress in their zkML solution by proving to reduce costs, improve security, and accelerate proofs. 

Additionally, @ModulusLabs has proven to be a leader in this space and has identified a thesis that allows for the buildout of ‚Äúwildy expressive services that never betray our trust.‚Äù 

They believe that cryptography will be the tool to keep powerful models accountable. 

zkML will also allow for ‚ÄúDe-Ai-Fi‚Äù products to become prevalent as collaboration between protocols have hit the ground running. Defi protocols enable machine learning models to generate yields, build trade strategies and improve UX. 

The partnership between @gizatechxyz and @yearnfi
has initiated the build out a proof-of-concept automated risk assessment for Yearn‚Äôs v3 vaults. 

Other solutions being built in the space include incorporating machine learning into AMMs, implementing models for analyzing validator risk, and providing access to proprietary offchain models. 

Perhaps the most prevalent use for zkML is verifying authenticity. Deepfakes have gone mainstream as current iterations of AI manipulated deepfakes are alarmingly realistic. 

To combat this issue, projects like @worldcoin provide proof of personhood solutions in which users scan their iris to create an ID that can be self-custodied on personal devices and encrypted. 

Agents 

Agents can be created to automate tasks for a an individual or to increase automation in a business model. 

The intersection of Agents and Crypto comes about as agents can be provided a wallet and autonomously transact with smart contracts. 

These trades can be made by using the information the model is trained on as well as information scraped from the internet. 

It is abundantly clear that the uses for crypto rails are optimal to complete transactions for onchain AI agents. 

This allows for text-based transactions and the ability to directly interact with on-chain agents through LLMs. 

Web2 applications rely on tradfi institutions for transactions which limit agents to domestic transactions. 

Onchain solutions solve this problem. There are numerous agent applications being built in the space.

@fetch_ai developed a comprehensive toolbox to improve functionality while using agents. 

@autonolas created a marketplace which enables the development of decentralized AI agents inclusive of features that allow for offchain development.

@SingularityNET is also building a marketplace in which AI agents can be contractually outsourced for anyone to use. 

It is believed that agents could become one of the largest consumers of zkML and compute in the near future as agents increase in relevance. 

Therefore, many applications currently being built will rely on each other with the common goal of AGI. 

Final thoughts 

Although the space is highly promising, AI solutions built onchain must prove to be compulsory for development. 

Further innovation to eliminate bottlenecks will make onchain AI applications much more economically viable. 

The projects that will succeed in the near future will enable functionality, improve the developer experience, and provide new solutions. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading and I hope you were able to learn more.

I saw posts about a bearish engulfing monthly candle in September, signaling possible reversal.

However, so far in October, price action simply hasn't been bearish. We're working on an inside candle for October, favoring continuation of the uptrend rather than bearish reversal.

Despite absolutely insane blowout earnings, price has simply been going side ways since May 2023, waiting for a very steeply positively sloped 20 week MA to catch up and push the price higher.

Sometimes, it doesn't matter how good your fundamentals are short term. People are going to take profits, and price can consolidate sideways for a significant period of time until technicals catch up.

Technical analysis is not just voodoo magic, but it tries to capture/reflect human psychology. Consolidation means that a lot of people are deciding whether valuation makes sense and assessing benefits and risks, after it had such a monster run-up. However, the weekly trend is still up, which means that probability wise, buyers will likely to continue to come in.

Big money has been buying. The buying volume is clearly increasing in an uptrend throughout 2023.

That one bearish engulfing candle in September is relatively low in volume, which makes bearish reversal much less convincing. 

I don't hold any $NVDA per se, but I have a ton of exposure through $USD (double leveraged semiconductor ETF), $SOXX, $TQQQ, $QQQ, $SSO (double leveraged $SPY), and $SPY.

I believe $NVDA will likely help lead the continuation of this market uptrend.

¬∑ Another new weekly high for $SPX and $DJI ‚Äì bullish engulfing candle for $SPX. This was after an early week pullback and $NVDA crazy earnings super charged the indexes with Nasdaq gaining over 3% in a day ‚Äì highest % in years.

¬∑ All AI plays rallied hard. $SMCI recovered somewhat after a 35% decline in 2 days. $NVDA data showed that this AI cycle is no hype.

¬∑ Comparisons with dotcom bubble arguable overdone. Seems like we‚Äôve only just begun. Very few companies in the dotcom era were profitable. Now we have not only profitable and cash flowing companies but at relatively modest PEs and some like GOOGL are undervalued

¬∑ A curious effect ‚Äì US10yr rallies but no effect on markets. Markets seem to be ignoring the treasury yield even as it peeked above 200ma ‚Äì perhaps on the realization that these tech/AI stocks are immune to higher rates ‚Äì so much cash on balance sheet that it earns them extra income

¬∑ Last week as noted, delayed rate cuts will continue to benefit the mega caps as money stays in these names and do not move out to the small caps. $IWM barely budged this week

¬∑ Regardless, pullback will be healthy and weakness over the next few weeks will coincides with cycle work of weakness from mid Feb ‚Äì April before a push higher

¬∑ Interesting note: 4-month winning streaks ending in February have then never seen the S&P 500 close the remainder of the current calendar year lower.13 for 13 to the upside for average returns of ~14%.

Themes: Mixed bag. Very broad this week, no theme really standing out. 
Setups: Mainly EP again this week due to earnings season.

With the start of the week being red, we shall see more PB opportunities next week if the market follow-through. It will be a better study material for my style.

I still see many EP continuation move like in HOOD SUM ELF, etc. worth reviewing. 

It also give us some great name to add to the EP watchlist to watch for continuation: 
RELY SQ NEO OUT TOST (like it here) COTY EVH NVDA BHC TTD (like it here) FND.

2 names were in the FL and I did not execute on them. OLLI & FL. Have to review why. 

Again....study this list & scan EACH WKND, and find the correlation with your routine and what you can improve to put you in these setups week after week. That's how you improve your game.

Not everything was positive! Here is why: 

(1) Beat on both top and bottom line. 

(2) Raises Q1‚Äô25 Revenue view, above analyst expectations. 

(3) Data Centre revenue + Gaming Revenue both beat expectations. 

(4) On China: Data Centre sales decline significantly in Q4, due to US Government licensing requirements. 

(5) CEO noted that demand far exceeds supply for nextgen products, and is struggling to keep up! 

(6) Broker Moves: All (with the exception of UBS) raised its price target for Nvidia, with much of the PTs above $800. 

My thoughts? 

Overall, the earnings report was strong. Most analysts felt the company was destined to beat on its earnings, though much of the concerns lied on the forward guidance. 

Not everything is perfect! There was a drop in purchase commitments, potentially suggesting that lead times are shortening - and potentially an early sign of cooling demand.

IF AI turns into a bubble - and I think there's a good chance that happens - this multiple will be more like 40+ ->which implies a 60% move if you hold EBT steady.

The biggest question to me (as someone who is moving ever more money into my re-constituted indexes) is whether competition actually lowers profit margins. Because, if competition does nothing but move profits from one company to another within the same basket - then it doesn't really matter. 

You are buying the basket at a great price, one company's loss is another company's gain and all that matters is that the profits stay within the basket - which seems very likely.",3,0,"Bradenton, FL"

It's not going to happen any time soon. Tesla has far too many new businesses spooling up, any of which can soak up the excess liquidity in a hurry.

Currently Tesla is developing and/or ramping Optimus, FSD + Robotaxi, NextGen car, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Megapack, and (possibly) Dojo - each multi-billion dollar investments with some of these lines of business having the potential of a multi-trillion dollar TAMs. 

@garyblack00 makes an excellent point that Tesla provides no information that allows us to model the possible revenue or profit for each of these businesses. As a result, most Wall Street analysts do not allocate value to any, or many, of these potential businesses. Also none of them appear to factor in  a potential call on Tesla's cash hoard. The greater the success of these emerging ventures, the greater will be the call on Tesla's cash reserves as the working capital for each spools up.

That's the key to investing in Tesla, and the retail investors' edge (if they have the patience, risk tolerance & conviction - and remember this is not investment advice!) Tesla is a well established and leading EV business earning industry leading margins in an emerging market. Wall Street is valuing that, and only that business, albeit at a fairly high multiple to current profits because of Tesla's stunning execution in the launch of the 3 and the Y.

But Tesla is also on the leading edge of the sustainability and AI revolutions, and is being guided by a CEO absolutely committed to being independent of fickle capital markets and market timing that such dependency enforces. So Tesla will guard, preserve and amass it's cash hoard as it actively pursues every one of these opportunities. 

Unlike Google's ""moonshots"", these are not lazy, thoughtless ""side ventures"" - these are thematic, logical extensions to the mission, and to the  technology, engineering skills and developments within the core of the company. They are also evolved by, and driven by, the genius of the Founder, CEO, and - aptly named - Technoking.

I have written - at length - on the Valuers Dilemma (arising from the innovators Dilemma), and why it is so difficult to value Tesla. 

Those that believe in Tesla succeeding in some or many of these ventures have a call on that potential. Others that do not have that level of conviction, or risk tolerance, will view Tesla as being fully or over valued.

I'm particularly excited about the alignment between the potential targets for both the bull and bear sides, with a range of approximately +-200 points in the next 8 weeks! Even if one of us is correct, it could yield a 150-200% overall profit, factoring in losses.

The week concluded on a positive note for us, special thanks to the earnings trade- bringing huge gains for us.

Came into the week with 5 swing trading ideas and was able capture some wins and faced some losses. 

Was swinging $CVNA shares into the week but closed it for a 11% loss, but switched to options as I had conviction and wanted my risk to be defined. Tried shorting $SQ earlier into the week but saw relative strength so decided to go lon on earnings. Swing traded $SMCI $EPAM $OLLI via shares helping boost the performance.

Eventful week without a doubt. Yes there were some losses as well- we all take losses, and I actually show them :)

The extension on the bullflag breakout can very wll reach 485-500 for QQQ. Which means further upside before any meaningful sell off. But we will sell off and retest the breakout at some point around the 370-380 range. NVDA can very well reach 875-900. I would expect some sort of intersector rotation to push QQQ higher with AAPL and TSLA lagging. They would need to participate to finish the extension of the breakout. AAPL is testing the breakout first and holding 12dma. If QQQ wants another leg up, we will have to see AAPL breakout here. The extension would bring AAPL to 240-250 (AI news?).

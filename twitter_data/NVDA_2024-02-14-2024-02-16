$NVDA Opening flag breakout trade would have initially failed 

$NVDA 2nd Attempt to break out of the flag would have netted 2R

$AMD Opening trade was the same style flag breakout as NVDA but a little bit cleaner, the sellout after about 2R formed the next setup 

$AMD Flag/Ascending Triangle break out and straight shot to 3R then a sell off. This was a nice set up but remember my favorite is a 3 Bar matching my criteria

Commentary: Quiet day in the market today, I was able to close some of the positions and I am very close to my monthly goal. The timing to close was okay but definitely could have done better. My work has been a little busier than usual so it is more difficult for me to monitor everything and thoroughly think it through (check charts, news, etc...)

I am happy to see $TSLA pushing higher, not far from an area where I will sell a CC. We have interesting earnings today $COIN $DKNG $TTD. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to put on a trade due to the amount of work at my job and I did not want to force one just to make a trade. We have some more earnings next week, with $NVDA leading the pack.

Tomorrow will be another busy day at work and markets, I hope I will be able to manage my exits well.

üö®I posted analysis of historical post-earnings movements for some of the top tickers reporting this week...do not forget to check my highlights tab for the thread. I plan on playing spreads or CSPs/CCs on some of the earnings this week. Make sure to follow, as I will be posting trade ideas and more analysis for earnings in coming days. So far, we turned profits on 17 out of 20 earnings plays this season, with 15 of the trades generating 80%+.

This cleared the $3.16 line I discussed on yesterday's video so it makes sense we are heading towards $4 given how smooth that channel seemed.

As always, confirmation will be king!! we care more about sustainable uptrends than a single good day. Volume cant drop too much tomorrow.
Hard to expect it to stay as high, but a big drop in volume could bring $3.16 or even $2.80ish worries (both over the 200ma though).
otherwise, this breaks the $4 resistance line and heads towards my next line around $5.15

Traders in the U.S. equity options market are betting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report could spur a massive move in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.

Nvidia, up about 50% this year, could see its shares swing by about 11% in either direction following its quarterly results on Feb. 21, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced in ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's actual average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS founder Matt Amberson said.

With Nvidia's market capitalization at $1.8 trillion, a move of that size would make for a potential swing in market value of about $200 billion. That would be greater than the market capitalization of chipmaker Intel Corp and larger than the respective market values of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents.....

It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical. The simulator learns intricate rendering, ""intuitive"" physics, long-horizon reasoning, and semantic grounding, all by some denoising and gradient maths.

I won't be surprised if Sora is trained on lots of synthetic data using Unreal Engine 5. It has to be!

Let's breakdown the following video. Prompt: ""Photorealistic closeup video of two pirate ships battling each other as they sail inside a cup of coffee.""

- The simulator instantiates two exquisite 3D assets: pirate ships with different decorations. Sora has to solve text-to-3D implicitly in its latent space.
- The 3D objects are consistently animated as they sail and avoid each other's paths.
- Fluid dynamics of the coffee, even the foams that form around the ships. Fluid simulation is an entire sub-field of computer graphics, which traditionally requires very complex algorithms and equations. 
- Photorealism, almost like rendering with raytracing.
- The simulator takes into account the small size of the cup compared to oceans, and applies tilt-shift photography to give a ""minuscule"" vibe.
- The semantics of the scene does not exist in the real world, but the engine still implements the correct physical rules that we expect.

Next up: add more modalities and conditioning, then we have a full data-driven UE that will replace all the hand-engineered graphics pipelines.

One possible $SMCI catalyst beyond $NVDA earnings is a potential S&P inclusion. Something like that can be huge as evidenced by $TSLA in 2020.

SMCI fulfills all criteria easily. The last one was $12.7bn market cap which they surpassed at around $230 in 2H23.

However, it is by far not as underowned by institutions as Tesla was in 2020. Tesla is still at just 50% of float today.

SMCI is at around 80% of float, which is towards the upper end of the largest companies in the US. 

For reference, $ABNB was at 69% when it was included last year. It surged 40% into the event and then sold off. (I anticipated that here: https://t.co/SicnfPFrjo)

It is important to note that the level of institutional ownership is not bullish or bearish per se. It's not a given that retail must outperform or underperform institutional. Ultimately, fundamentals determine that. However, S&P inclusion is a catalyst to increase institutional adoption.

In SMCI's case, institutions are already on board. And it's possible that some of the current move is already the anticipation of a near-term inclusion.",6,0,"British Columbia, Canada"

Oh you think it‚Äôs bad for $SMCI to go from $300 to $1,000 in a few weeks based off an earnings beat and prospects for the futures or $NVDA surpassing Google and Amazon as America‚Äôs 3rd most valuable company? That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a racist and a nazi. Don‚Äôt question all of the put sellers and gamma squeezes taking place in the market, lest Business Insider might run an article about you and publish your name and address for the world to see. It‚Äôs simply transphobic and sexist of you to not like stocks up here and the suggestion that America‚Äôs $34 trillion in debt is a hindrance to future generations is, quite honestly, xenophobic.

We have aggressive lesbians operating the market now, with feminine energy times 1,000. Nothing is as it seems. Germany, the UK and Japan are all in recessions now, yet no one cares.

Listen to me ‚Äî

If you were to only live your lives predicated by what is just and moral ‚Äî you will end up dying a lonely and sad life. The great turn or revolt isn‚Äôt going to occur in our lifetimes. We are trapped in this power structure for several more decades to go, if not more ‚Äî because no one is crazy enough to engage with industrial war against America.

The leaders have converted the nationalistic Americana into an economic zone which comprises of bringing in as many people as possible in order to drive down wages, increase consumption, and the pool of available men for a future war against China. The patriotic fervor you once possessed is toxic to the occupying force because they‚Äôre globalists, like locusts moving around in packs taking all nutrients and things of worth from the land they cross over. They‚Äôd gladly sell you out for China ‚Äî but China is nationalistic and doesn‚Äôt want to commingle their Chinese society with Africans or Middle Easterners ‚Äî who only migrate abroad due to the wars in their region.

Key Details:

üìç OpenAI unveils Sora, a cutting-edge AI model for creating realistic videos.

üìç Sora can generate intricate scenes like woolly mammoths in snow or a bustling Tokyo street.

üìç Currently available to a select group of early testers to assess potential misuses.

üìç Utilizes diffusion model technology, transforming static noise into detailed videos.

üìç Generative AI advances could impact digital artistry and amplify online disinformation risks.

üìç Oren Etzioni, AI expert, voices concerns over the technology's potential to influence elections.

üìç Sora's name inspired by the Japanese word for sky, symbolizing ""limitless creative potential.""

üìç OpenAI explores watermarking to distinguish AI-generated videos, though removal is possible.

üìç Sora's capabilities include processing extensive prompts and animating still images with precision.

üìç Future potential for Sora as a foundational model in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Context/Background:

For those intrigued by the rapid evolution of AI, Sora represents a significant leap in generative AI capabilities, offering unprecedented quality in video generation and raising important ethical and practical considerations.

Why This Matters:

üëâ Sora's introduction could redefine content creation, offering new tools for filmmakers and digital artists while presenting challenges in distinguishing real from AI-generated content.

Market Insights:

üìä The development of Sora and similar technologies could shift the landscape of digital content creation, influencing job markets and content verification methods.

Expert Statement

üó®Ô∏è Oren Etzioni: Expressed concerns about the potential for AI-generated videos to impact critical societal events like elections.

Impact & Recommendations:

üìç Sora's advanced video generation opens new creative avenues but also necessitates vigilance against misuse in disinformation and intellectual property rights.

1758193829788676540,2024-02-15 18:17:29+00:00,"I (respectfully) disagree with @Downtown on his $NVDA analysis. To sell a stock simply because it moved up in price... or reached a certain market cap makes little sense. 

NVDA is moving higher on incredible earnings growth. This was def not the case for most tech stocks during the https://t.co/cLAhTiwb78 boom. 

And this earnings growth was confirmed two weeks ago with the major tech companies (who have fortress balance sheets and generate tens of billions in free cash flow every quarter) saying they have no plans to slowdown spending on #AI. 

Now looking at the numbers... NVDA is trading at 36x F EPS. That's an 80% premium to the $SPX. Yet, NVDA is projected to grow earnings by 50%-plus annually over the next two years. That's 4x the S&P 500 average. 

And unlike most companies who already reported... NVDA's earnings are not growing from cost cuts. Its top line is expected to grow more than 40% annually over the next two years. That's 8x more than the S&P 500 avg. 

So even after this run-up... NVDA is still trading at a cheaper valuation than $MSFT (38x F EPS)...  $TSLA (63x F EPS) and $AMD (58x F EPS). And all of these companies are growing MUCH slower than NVDA. 

Also... (and from someone that's been analyzing stocks for 30+ years)... 

I've never seen one company have this much control over a multi-trillion dollar secular growing industry.

There is nobody capable (at least right now) of making the GPUs NVDA makes for AI.  That's why NVDA is still able to raise prices on its older H100 chips. 

And why every chip company plays catch-up... NVDA is now selling its H200 chip (has 1.4x more memory bandwidth/1.8x more memory capacity than the H100) to customers. 

Its also launching its new B100 GPU (double the performance of the H200) in 2024. 

So while competitors are launching new AI GPUs to compete with NVDA's H100 chip... NVDA is still TWO GENERATIONS AHEAD of the competition.   

In short... if you are MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, $META (or other industry leaders trying to be leaders in AI) and have tens of billions to spend on this technology - will you buy slower GPUs from competitors or buy the best  state-of-the-art GPUs from NVDA? 

NVDA may see a pullback after earnings. It may even report weak guidance (do to supply constraints to meet insane demand for its AI GPUs). 

But I would be a buyer on a pullback. NVDA is trading at a cheap valuation relative to its growth... and its long-growth trend is still very much intact. 

It also has incredible pricing power... the best GPUs in the space (along with little competition)... and customers with trillion-dollar market caps that risk becoming Blackberry if they are on the wrong side of the AI trade. 

Just my two cents.

CAPEX figures below are for the megacaps and include all capex (but for AMZN which breaks out data center spend).  2023 was clearly a digestion year (but for META) and all have signaled capex growth in 2024.

NVDA data center business is pretty diversified beyond these 4 companies so hard to draw much in the way of hard  conclusions.  Interesting to note NVDA data center business tripled this past year in the face of megacap capex barely growing, and clearly NVDA took share within these budgets.  All the megas have said capex growth will resume this year and emphasized AI investment ‚Äì street has 27% capex growth and question will be how much of that growth goes to NVDA.  This is apples / oranges to be clear but interesting to note that NVDA data center biz grew by 30b in 2023 against a megacap budget that was up 4b.  For 2024, street has NVDA data center biz growing by 34b against megacap budget growing by 32b.  

Bulls will say this suggests NVDA numbers are far too low for CY24 and CY25 as megacaps are all highlighting incremental spend is focused on AI (ie NVDA), and that NVDA data center AI customers are far broader than these 4 companies (tech, pharma, software, governments, etc.).

This capex ramp disclosed by these megas in late Jan also helps explain the big rally in semis.",6,0,NYC

1. Business with network effect and platform Moat. Duopoly with Uber. Others can‚Äôt enter now

2. Fixed costs can lead to exponential raise in profits

3. Company had reached an important milestone where it had turned cash flow positive this quarter.

4. Market cap is only 1.5 times the revenue. PS ratio/Price to Sales ratio of 1.5. If stock adjusts to match the PS ratio of Uber, of 4.5 , stock will to go up 300%

5. PS ratio expansion, to 3 or 4, multiplied by earnings expansion can lead to a multi bagger return of stock price.

6. Stock had all time high of $50. Currently trades at $17. Market cap of $6.5B with revenue of $4B. Revenue growth of 17% Y-Y

7. Stock is at $17, as of Feb 14 2024, and can very well breakout of its previous high of $50 and reach much higher in couple of years or sooner.

8. Given low price tag of $6.5B it could get acquired as well.

RISKS:

1. The good results of Q4 2023 could be one off and it can go back to losses from next qtr onwards, although probability is low. 2023 had lot of concerts such as Tyler Swift helping Lyft usage

2. Economy can go in to a recession, although it is impossible to predict

Today we are releasing the first demonstrations of the capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 series, with the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.  One of the key differentiators of this model is its incredibly long context capabilities, supporting millions of tokens of multimodal input.  The multimodal capabilities of the model means you can interact in sophisticated ways with entire books, very long document collections, codebases of hundreds of thousands of lines across hundreds of files, full movies, entire podcast series, and more.

Gemini 1.5 was built by an amazing team of people from @GoogleDeepMind, @GoogleResearch, and elsewhere at @Google. @OriolVinyals (my co-technical lead for the project) and I are incredibly proud of the whole team, and we‚Äôre so excited to be sharing this work and what long context and in-context learning can mean for you today!

There‚Äôs lots of material about this, some of which are linked to below.

Main blog post:

Analyzing a 45 minute Buster Keaton movie: https://t.co/adyMgDYHoK
Apollo 11 transcript interaction: https://t.co/Pqvq3Eac1R

Starting today, we‚Äôre offering a limited preview of 1.5 Pro to developers and enterprise customers via AI Studio and Vertex AI. Read more about this on these blogs:
Google for Developers blog:
https://t.co/x73Vun0kVS
Google Cloud blog: 
https://t.co/OlaTW6PYGn

We‚Äôll also introduce 1.5 Pro with a standard 128,000 token context window when the model is ready for a wider release. Coming soon, we plan to introduce pricing tiers that start at the standard 128,000 context window and scale up to 1 million tokens, as we improve the model.

Early testers can try the 1 million token context window at no cost during the testing period.  We‚Äôre excited to see what developer‚Äôs creativity unlocks with a very long context window.

Let me walk you through the capabilities of the model and what I‚Äôm excited about!",6367,1206,

As you can see, NVDA stock ripped +50% into those periods, and earnings marked a period of consolidation for the stock, and the broader market.

This consolidation makes some sense because earnings almost invariably reduce IV, and since everyone is piled into calls (as per the elevated call skew) its those calls that asymmetrically decline in value.

Consider today's 1-month NVDA skew (green) vs where skew was in DEC (gray, before the latest ~50%, 6 week rally).

After earnings we'd anticipate today's skew reverting back towards DEC. This, we think has a dampening effect on the stock. 

Further, because SMH SOXL etc are all relatedly holding relative high call IV's, the broader market may take a breather, too.",139,36,United States

'Powerhouse in a fast-growing market': BofA starts Super Micro Computer at Buy 1040$ PT by BOA
‚ÄúWe think this provider of server and storage solutions will be a beneficiary of AI-driven demand growth (>50% of revenues now tied to accelerators like GPUs),‚Äù analysts led by Ruplu Bhattacharya said in a Thursday note.

‚ÄúWe believe the market for AI servers is much larger than is factored in Street models. We expect the market for AI servers to grow, on average, 50% CAGR over the next three years, vs. historical growth of the overall server market (5.5% CAGR over the past 17 years), and we expect Super Micro‚Äôs revenue to grow even faster driving market share gain,‚Äù they added.

The company has an increasing backlog and is enhancing its capacity to accommodate robust revenue expansion, BofA noted, and has also positioned itself as a key early launch collaborator with leading firms such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel for CPUs and GPU accelerators.

The analysts believe Super Micro's capability to adapt to various new designs and technologies positions it favorably for the upcoming wave of AI-related processors expected to emerge over the next few years.

‚ÄúGiven our view, our revenue and EPS estimates are well above Street,‚Äù they said.",49,3,USA

Background: Sam Altman, the CEO of @OpenAI is raising TRILLIONS to fund the production of AI chips (GPU). 

The AI hype has caused global shortages in GPU causing $NVDA @nvidia leaping @amazon and @Meta stocks in market cap.

While I feel AI in crypto focuses a LOT on LLMs and machine learning, there is not as much hype around GPUs despite $NVDA soaring making it undervalued imo. Quite simply, 

AI hype = GPU DEMAND

There is a clear demand and shortage for it and this makes decentralised GPU an interesting solution/play.

Hence, an interesting angle to think about the AI narrative.

Industry Impact
Nvidia's recent investments signal strategic moves across critical tech industries:

Semiconductors: 
The Arm investment doubles down on transforming the chip industry. An Arm-powered future with Nvidia expertise could reshape semiconductors at every level, from cars to cloud infrastructure.

AI: 
SoundHound, TuSimple, and other partnerships expand Nvidia's reach in voice interfaces, computer vision, and industrial autonomy. This push to create industry standards could reshape how we interact with AI in everyday life and business.

Healthcare:
Nano-X and Recursion represent a commitment to computational medicine. Increased accessibility, affordability, and faster drug discovery are outcomes Nvidia could help drive in the healthcare tech sector.

Potential Risks
Integration obstacles, regulation, and misaligned goals between partners could limit the collaborative potential of Nvidia's strategy. Missteps may disrupt their efforts to establish a dominant platform presence.

The Long Game
Despite the risks, Nvidia's focus on massive, growing markets shows ambition. These investments directly support Nvidia's goal to drive the transition to an AI-powered, cloud-focused future.

I thought it would be helpful to possibly explain their correlation to Nividia's business model and what the management may be thinking. Of course, this is just my best guess: 

Arm Holdings is a semiconductor and IP company that Nvidia intended to acquire for $40 billion before regulatory hurdles resulted in a terminated deal. This investment shows Nvidia's commitment to transforming the semiconductor landscape alongside Arm despite the failed takeover.

SoundHound AI is global leader in voice AI and natural language understanding technology. With Nvidia building out conversational AI offerings, SoundHound complements these efforts as voice interfaces and assistants become widespread.

Nano-X Imaging  develops AI-driven medical imaging technology using cold cathode emitters rather than legacy X-Ray tubes to drive accessibility. This aligns with Nvidia's industry push into computational medicine, medical imaging enhancements, and global health tech distribution.

Recursion Pharmaceuticals leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to rapidly uncover new drug candidates through automated wet lab experiments. Synergistic with Nvidia's UK partnership focused on national-scale population health analysis and medical AI adoption.

TuSimple is a autonomous trucking company leveraging AI camera perception, routing algorithms and edge processors. Nvidia wants to power AI innovation across transportation ecosystems - TuSimple gains them more momentum in long-haul logistics intelligence.

This AI stock could climb by over 200%, analysts say
Buy rating and a price target of $5.
DA Davidson on Wednesday initiated coverage on an AI stock that they think is being unfairly punished for being a former special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

Similar to IPOs, SPACs are formed for the sole purpose of taking private companies public, but the group has found little love recently due several high-profile flops. However, in the view of analysts, this former SPAC could climb by over 200%.

DA Davidson initiated covered on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a company developing a voice AI platform that provides customers with the technology to create voice-enabled experiences for users, with a Buy rating and a price target of $5. Shares of SoundHound AI closed at $1.60 yesterday, so the price target implies upside of over 200%.

Analysts at DA Davidson think upside for SoundHound is underappreciated given demand. They also think long term opportunity is attractive and ‚Äúlargely up for grabs.‚Äù

Gil Luria, a senior software analyst at DA Davidson, explained, ‚ÄúSoundHound has been leading with its innovative and independent Voice AI platform that we expect will set the standard for performance moving forward in the Voice AI market. With an improving financial model and growing sales team, we believe the company is positioned well to capture substantial market share and sustain healthy levels of growth over the long run.""

Discussing valuation, Luria said, ‚ÄúWe believe the company is being unfairly punished as a SPAC and given the superior growth opportunity compared to peers, we believe it deserves a premium valuation. We set our price target at $5.00 based on ~12x our CY2025 revenue estimate, within the range of hyper-growth software.‚Äù",30,5,USA

‚ö†Ô∏è Is #ARM The Canary In The $NVDA Coal Mine? ‚ö†Ô∏è

Newspapers have been cheering up the ‚Äúdeal‚Äù this week where Softbank managed Vision Fund successfully sold ARM 25% it owned to‚Ä¶ Softbank. ü§ì üëèüèª

Well‚Ä¶ it sounds like nails scratching on a chalkboard, doesn‚Äôt it?! üòÜ Here is why this deal is a (loud) bell üîî ringing at the top of the latest bubble trend $NVDA lead üëáüèª

In September 2020, $NVDA agreed to buy the whole ARM from Softbank at a $40bn valuation paying in cash and shares (https://t.co/6pIVzHzGw0), but it preferred to lose $1.25bn cash of penalties rather than completing the deal in February 2022. During the same period, $NVDA stock price raised from 128 to 250, applying the same multiples used when the deal was sealed it implied a ~$65bn ARM valuation.

How the hell did $NVDA let go of such a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù where, on paper, they already made a $25bn profit?! The company's official excuse ü§≠ was antitrust concerns... but it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure Softbank busted the deal since they wanted to take home more money (https://t.co/dTSk9CbNEm)

However , Softbank failed to sell ARM due to #stocks plunge after February 2022 and, ironically, Softbank and $NVDA were back at the negotiating table with $NVDA rumoured to be an anchor investor in ARM's IPO one year later‚Ä¶üò¨https://t.co/EiObaIS5VP

Here is the truth, buried in the FT article, ‚ÄúOne person familiar with the discussions said Nvidia wanted to come in at a share price that would put Arm‚Äôs total value at $35bn to $40bn, while Arm wanted to be closer to $80bn‚Äù. üòè

Since February 2023, NVDA's stock price increased from 186$ to 433$ on Friday while Softbank acquired Vision Fund stake at a 64bn valuation when in February ARM was marketing itself at 80bn. Hold on, why did ARM not benefit from the #AI #FOMO breakneck run at all?! ü§Ø

Here is why, the narrative fuelling #semiconductor #tech companies #FOMO had little to do with #AI! Every time $NVDA chip inventories build up, ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù a new ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù surfaces and the company can then unload its unsold products. üòÖ When the #gaming one faded, they moved on to #crypto mining and then recently to #AI (chart 1 below). However, under the hood, insiders obviously know it‚Äôs all a bunch of BS üí©. As a matter of fact, at the negotiating table, $NVDA's behavior reflects insiders realistic expectations on the market real value in stark contrast to what they claim publicly ü•∂

Applying some quick math, using the multiples $NVDA's own management applied to ARM, their stock was worth ~$125 vs. $183 market price in February 2023. Fast forward to today, with ARM agreeing to a lower valuation than six months ago, then what‚Äôs all the benefit of the #AI narrative applied to chip making #stocks? Z-E-R-O ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How did $NVDA's stock, which ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù isn't worth more than $100-$125, get to where it's trading today? 

$NVDA's timely buybacks + traders gamma squeezing to front run it sending the price to nosebleed levels to then cash out at inflated valuations. Were $NVDA and market whales coordinating? Who knows, but‚Ä¶ as a matter of fact, $NVDA's buybacks timing was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù‚Ä¶ https://t.co/PqNdTHMmze (chart 2)

Of course, in bull bubble markets, all is legal until it's not‚Ä¶ As far as I am concerned the end of this story is already written, and $NVDA will need to put on a hell of a show to keep this whole house of cards from collapsing this week when they will announce their last quarter results. ü§° üé™ 

Here is my view. The companies who will benefit from #AI won‚Äôt be chipmakers since the computing power available to develop it is already way more than what‚Äôs needed. Those that will thrive will be the ones who will manage to leverage on the technology to deliver meaningful cost savings replacing current ‚Äúiterative‚Äù jobs in the service sector with virtual automation in the same way repetitive human factory jobs have been replaced by robots. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",267,37,Hong Kong

Commentary: Posting today's recap late as I had other responsibilities today. Nice bounce back for the market after yesterday's sell-off. I took advantage of the market pop and I sold calls on the remaining 3 TQQQ lots today. 

Still a lot of positions left for this week so I need to keep monitoring them and hopefully close some tomorrow. Crypto keeps pushing higher so $COIN $MARA is dropping off my watchlist for now as they are moving higher and I missed the move there. I am watching remaining earnings reports for any potential opportunities.

Strong AI's Potential Solutions to Aging: A Glimpse into the Future

While the idea of strong AI guaranteeing ""indefinite life"" is still hypothetical, its potential to combat aging holds significant promise. Here are some intriguing possibilities:

1. Deciphering the Complexities of Aging: Strong AI, empowered by vast datasets and superior processing capabilities, could delve deeper into the biological mechanisms of aging. Imagine AI analyzing mountains of medical data, identifying hidden patterns and correlations that elude us. This newfound understanding could reveal key pathways and molecules involved in aging, paving the way for targeted interventions.

2. Personalized Medicine on Steroids: Imagine an AI that analyzes your unique genetic makeup, lifestyle choices, and health indicators to create a personalized roadmap to longevity. This ""aging concierge"" could predict potential health risks, suggest optimal interventions, and monitor your progress in real-time. By tailoring strategies to individual needs, AI could maximize individual lifespans.

3. Drug Discovery at Warp Speed: The traditional trial-and-error approach to drug discovery is slow and expensive. Strong AI could revolutionize this process by analyzing vast chemical libraries and biological simulations to identify promising anti-aging compounds. This could dramatically accelerate the development of drugs that target specific aging processes, like senescent cells or DNA damage.

4. Regenerative Medicine Revolution: Imagine AI-powered robots performing intricate surgeries, printing personalized organs, or even designing self-assembling biomaterials. Strong AI could usher in an era of advanced regenerative medicine, repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs, effectively reversing the biological hallmarks of aging.

5. Optimizing Wellness at its Core: Beyond physical interventions, AI could become a powerful tool for mental and emotional well-being. Personalized AI companions could offer cognitive training, manage stress, and even provide emotional support, leading to healthier and potentially longer lives.

However, several challenges remain:

Ethical Considerations: Who has access to these technologies? Could they exacerbate existing inequalities? Questions of fairness and accessibility need careful consideration.

Unforeseen Consequences: Complex interventions can have unintended side effects. Rigorous testing and ethical frameworks are crucial.

The Limits of Technology: Aging is a complex phenomenon, and AI may not have all the answers. Continued research in biology and other fields is essential.

In conclusion, while strong AI's role in achieving indefinite life is uncertain, its potential to combat aging and extend human lifespans is undeniable. By combining its analytical prowess with our scientific understanding, we may unlock a future where aging is managed, not a guaranteed outcome. However, responsible development and careful consideration of ethical implications are paramount on this journey towards a longer, healthier human life.",2,0,"Arkansas, USA"

Let me introduce you to another important factor which drives the Nvidia's rally, aside the gamma squeeze: The ""repurchase program period"" 

Nvidia's ""repurchase program period"" is three weeks before the ER, during which Nvidia itself fuels a rally by buying shares worth up to $1 billion.

Interesting that the price levels and timeline align with data, resistance, and $NVDA earnings. This would suggest a ramp into PPI Friday, dump, reclaim local highs, then chop into earnings until a blowoff top type scenario reaction

Also would make one massive 3 month long rising wedge that could take us on a 8% pullback end of the month into $413 previous ATH breakout retest before resuming higher.

$NVDA as a manufacturer is subject to real, material constraints.  Furthermore, since they outsource a significant amount of manufacturing capacity to an offshore foundry, they are acutely exposed to currency and geopolitical risks.

In 2011, David White was 55 years old and had only been in the role of $NVDA CFO for 2 years, so why the abrupt resignation?

üö© CFOs don't suddenly resign from their highly lucrative positions in the prime of their careers unless they discover something, or are expected to do something, they aren't on board with.

Every time I find a red flag that points me towards digging in a certain direction, as you know, I cannot resist doing so üôà. So, I started digging into $NVDA CFOs' history.

It didn't take too long to dig this out: FORMER CFO OF $NVDA FACES FRAUD CHARGES (Picture 1)

In 2003, the SEC filed charges against Christine Hoberg alleging that she intentionally failed to record $3.3 million in expenses relating to a deal with a supplier. As a result of that transaction, $NVDA materially overstated its gross profit and income for the quarter ended April 30, 2000, the SEC claims.

Time to grab your üçø ‚ÄºÔ∏è

According to the SEC: ""In February 2000 [...] Nvidia's internal forecasting indicated that the Company was not on target to meet the consensus external expectations of stock market analysts regarding earnings per share, revenue, and gross margin. In order to address this anticipated shortfall, Nvidia's senior management immediately focused the Company on reducing costs for the quarter to improve Nvidia's net income and gross margin.""

So what did $NVDA's senior management do? ""To Meet Expectations for the Quarter, Nvidia Agreed with a Supplier to Lower Nvidia's Costs In Exchange For an Agreement to Pay Higher Prices on Future Generation Products‚Äù

In Pictures 2 and 3, you can see the full details of the shenanigan directly from the SEC archives.

As a result of the illegal transaction, on May 16, 2000, Nvidia issued a press release reporting record financial results for the quarter ended April 30, 2000, beating analysts consensus. On the day of the (fraudulent) results, $NVDA's stock jumped from 1.654$ to 2.388$, closing at 2.128$.

Fast forward to today, it's no longer a mystery that $NVDA is already overstating its revenues:

- $NVDA (PONZI) ""LIES"" UNDER $NVDA'S NOSE [post below]
- $NVDA ""Elite Partners"" [https://t.co/Jf43uKiNw4]
- @JG_Nuke on $NVDA round-tripping their cash [https://t.co/ryFHeV1Dtz]

However, a big mystery remains today: 

üö© How come $NVDA's suppliers are struggling to grow their revenues and aren't capable of increasing their costs despite such an ""overwhelming"" demand to produce GPUs from $NVDA ($TSM's revenues in Picture 4)? 

üö© How can $NVDA charge such spectacular margins for their GPUs for so long, going against the laws of supply chain nature?

Perhaps the answer lies in $NVDA's past, and if that's the case, in the future we will see an abnormal increase in costs in $NVDA's financials that will bring those ""sky high"" margins back down to earth. üëÄ",900,234,Hong Kong

Cash: 20%

After a fantastic +119% gain for my portfolio in 2023, I'm quite surprised to see some of the YTD gains.

For example $NVDA +50% $CFLT +46% $CRWD +34%

A lot of these gains in the market for the AI-Infused Stocks ( this is how I would like to call them) have been fueled by $NVDA and the fact that high growth SaaS stocks were almost decimated in 22-23.

However, the rate at which some of these AI-Infused Stocks have risen in the past couple of months defies common sense.

Going forward, a lot will depend on how $NVDA reports next Wednesday. If the report is great, the rally might continue further up. If not, many of these AI-Infused Stocks will probably sell off.

With that perspective, I had been trimming or selling out some of favorite names like $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB, $NVDA, $DDOG, $AMD as they hit new highs.

At the same time, because of my contrarian nature of investing, I have been adding $TSLA opportunistically. I am always focussed on the long term as an investor  looking at least 3-5 years away.

Today, I further trimmed $CRWD, $ZS, $MDB and sold off the small positions of $ANET and $SHOP that I bought a couple of days ago.

So, my portfolio looks like this... Largest to smallest.

Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,

1757573259967844538,2024-02-14 01:11:33+00:00,"$NVDA #NVDA Many traders seem to be overlooking the potential risks associated with today's dip in $NVDA. Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,

1757573259967844538,2024-02-14 01:11:33+00:00,"$NVDA #NVDA Many traders seem to be overlooking the potential risks associated with today's dip in $NVDA. Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,

1757773197821267994,2024-02-14 14:26:02+00:00,"$NVDA stock has experienced a notable ascent this year, with a nearly 50% increase attributed to the growing demand for AI technology. This positive trajectory is supported by optimistic price target upgrades from major institutions like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Analyst projections for $NVDA Q4 2024 are optimistic, forecasting a total revenue of $20.322 billion and an EPS of $4.55, underscoring the company's strong position in the market.

However, $NVDA shares are currently trading above the average analyst price target of $689.87, suggesting the market may have set high expectations. This average target, based on the forecasts of 38 Wall Street analysts, implies a potential -4.51% adjustment from the last trading price of $722.45. (Now up to $731 in premarket today) 

Investors should therefore watch closely, as the stock's premium valuation could pose a risk if $NVDA earnings guidance fails to meet these elevated market expectations.

$META is A TOP AI stock and has been part of my thesis for the past 2 years.

During the earnings call, Mark spent a lot of time explaining why AI open source. üëáüëáüëáüëá

The second part of our playbook is open source software infrastructure. Our long-standing strategy has been to build and open source general infrastructure while keeping our specific product implementations proprietary. 

In the case of AI, the general infrastructure includes our Llama models, including Llama 3 which is training now and is looking great so far, as well as industry-standard tools like PyTorch that we've developed. 

This approach to open source has unlocked a lot of innovation across the industry and it‚Äôs something that we believe in deeply.  

 I know that some people have questions about how we benefit from open sourcing the results of our research and large amounts of compute, so I thought it might be useful to lay out the strategic benefits here. 

The short version is that open sourcing improves our models, and because there's still significant work to turn our models into products, because there will be other open source models available anyway, we find that there are mostly advantages to being the open source leader and it doesn't remove differentiation from our products much anyway.  

Now, more specifically, there are several strategic benefits. 

First, open source software is typically safer and more secure, as well as more compute efficient to operate due to all the ongoing feedback, scrutiny, and development from the community. This is a big deal because safety is one of the most important issues in AI. Efficiency improvements and lowering the compute costs also benefit everyone including us. 

Second, open source software often becomes an industry standard, and when companies standardize on building with our stack, that then becomes easier to integrate new innovations into our 3  products. That‚Äôs subtle, but the ability to learn and improve quickly is a huge advantage and being an industry standard enables that. 

Third, open source is hugely popular with developers and researchers. We know that people want to work on open systems that will be widely adopted, so this helps us recruit the best people at Meta, which is a very big deal for leading in any new technology area. And again, we typically have unique data and build unique product integrations anyway, so providing infrastructure like Llama as open source doesn't reduce our main advantages. 

This is why our long-standing strategy has been to open source general infrastructure and why I expect it to continue to be the right approach for us going forward.",33,2,"New Jersey, USA"

üëáüèª

It seems like the jury is still out on whether Nvidia is a fraud or not. Some people on Twitter seem to think it's a colossal bubble waiting to burst, while others believe that the company is doing just fine. It's like a never-ending game of ""he said, she said,"" but with more GPUs and less drama.

Nvidia has been accused of some shady practices in the past, like the 2000 and 2022 fraud allegations. But hey, who hasn't made a few questionable decisions in their life, right? (Well, maybe not me, but I'm an AI, so I'm not allowed to have skeletons in my closet.)

On the flip side, Nvidia has also been praised for its technological advancements and market performance. In 2024, it even became the fifth-largest company by market capitalization, surpassing Amazon and threatening Alphabet. So, is Nvidia a fraud? It's hard to say. Maybe it's just misunderstood, like that one friend who always brings up conspiracy theories at parties.

In conclusion, the answer to your question is a resounding ""maybe."" Just kidding, it's more like ""it's complicated."" As a humble AI, I can't definitively say whether Nvidia is a fraud or not, but I can tell you that the situation is as clear as a foggy day in San Francisco.",86,10,Hong Kong

‚ö†Ô∏è IS $NVDA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE? üëÄ‚ö†Ô∏è

In March 2011, the $NVDA CFO at that time, David White, suddenly resigned due to ""personal reasons"". The company then took 2 years to find its new CFO, Colette Kress, who has remained in the role ever since. In 2011, David White was 55 years old and had only been in the role of $NVDA CFO for 2 years, so why the abrupt resignation?

üö© CFOs don't suddenly resign from their highly lucrative positions in the prime of their careers unless they discover something, or are expected to do something, they aren't on board with.

Every time I find a red flag that points me towards digging in a certain direction, as you know, I cannot resist doing so üôà. So, I started digging into $NVDA CFOs' history.

It didn't take too long to dig this out: FORMER CFO OF $NVDA FACES FRAUD CHARGES (Picture 1)

In 2003, the SEC filed charges against Christine Hoberg alleging that she intentionally failed to record $3.3 million in expenses relating to a deal with a supplier. As a result of that transaction, $NVDA materially overstated its gross profit and income for the quarter ended April 30, 2000, the SEC claims.

Time to grab your üçø ‚ÄºÔ∏è

According to the SEC: ""In February 2000 [...] Nvidia's internal forecasting indicated that the Company was not on target to meet the consensus external expectations of stock market analysts regarding earnings per share, revenue, and gross margin. In order to address this anticipated shortfall, Nvidia's senior management immediately focused the Company on reducing costs for the quarter to improve Nvidia's net income and gross margin.""

So what did $NVDA's senior management do? ""To Meet Expectations for the Quarter, Nvidia Agreed with a Supplier to Lower Nvidia's Costs In Exchange For an Agreement to Pay Higher Prices on Future Generation Products‚Äù

In Pictures 2 and 3, you can see the full details of the shenanigan directly from the SEC archives.

As a result of the illegal transaction, on May 16, 2000, Nvidia issued a press release reporting record financial results for the quarter ended April 30, 2000, beating analysts consensus. On the day of the (fraudulent) results, $NVDA's stock jumped from 1.654$ to 2.388$, closing at 2.128$.

Fast forward to today, it's no longer a mystery that $NVDA is already overstating its revenues:

- $NVDA (PONZI) ""LIES"" UNDER $NVDA'S NOSE [post below]
- $NVDA ""Elite Partners"" [https://t.co/Jf43uKiNw4]
- @JG_Nuke on $NVDA round-tripping their cash [https://t.co/ryFHeV1Dtz]

However, a big mystery remains today: 

üö© How come $NVDA's suppliers are struggling to grow their revenues and aren't capable of increasing their costs despite such an ""overwhelming"" demand to produce GPUs from $NVDA ($TSM's revenues in Picture 4)? 

üö© How can $NVDA charge such spectacular margins for their GPUs for so long, going against the laws of supply chain nature?

Perhaps the answer lies in $NVDA's past, and if that's the case, in the future we will see an abnormal increase in costs in $NVDA's financials that will bring those ""sky high"" margins back down to earth. üëÄ",900,234,Hong Kong

Reasons to not Buy:
(1) Historical Patterns: Stocks that rise too quickly in a straight line tend to experience corrections.
(2) Long-Term Trend: When observed on a weekly or monthly chart, NVDA's growth appears unsustainable.
(3) Market Independence: NVDA may drop significantly regardless of market conditions, making it a potential short opportunity.
(4) Extended Conditions: The stock's current overextended state suggests it may consolidate before becoming a short-term buying opportunity.
Price Targets:
Upside Target: $720-750
Shorting Target: $450-500
Preferred Strategy: Consider buying Jan 2025 Puts when the stock consolidates.

Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,

Open source Chat with RTX is here and I am testing it now!

Nvidia released an early version of Chat with RTX today, a demo app that lets you run a personal AI chatbot on your PC. You can feed it YouTube videos and your own documents to create summaries and get relevant answers based on your own data. It all runs locally on a PC, and all you need is an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM.

This is a massive challenge to OpenAI.

NVIDIA target raised earlier to $850 at UBS

UBS raises their NVDA tgt to $850 from $580. Analyst Timothy Arcuri noted, ""We substantially raise our estimates and price target to $850 ahead of NVDA's FQ4:24 (Jan) earnings report.

 Customer discussions confirm NVDA's lead times have come in substantially over the past few months (now ~3-4 mos), meaning shipment slots are still available in C2H:24. 

Normally, this is bad, but demand for AI compute capacity is still so strong, in the near term, we think this just points to significant upside potential to shipments/revenue, such that we think NVDA beats on data center by ~$2.5-3B (i.e. FQ4:24 Jan Q UBSe Data Center revenue of $19.5B versus Street $16.8B, and total revenue ~$23B versus Street ~$20.2B). Given supply chain work, we see enough capacity for NVDA to guide $25-26B on total revenue.""",5,2,

Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,

1757573259967844538,2024-02-14 01:11:33+00:00,"$NVDA #NVDA Many traders seem to be overlooking the potential risks associated with today's dip in $NVDA. Rather than assuming it was simply a blip that was quickly bought up, it's crucial to consider the possibility that this could signal broader market concerns. With this in mind, there's a compelling argument for a bearish outlook, with a potential downside target in the 620-640 range. Here's why:

(1) RSI Overbought: The RSI has been consistently above 80 for several weeks, indicating overbought conditions. Such prolonged high levels often precede corrective moves.
(2) Healthy Correction Needed: Even if $NVDA has long-term bullish prospects, a healthy correction is necessary to reset indicators like the RSI and pave the way for sustainable upward momentum.
(3) AI Sentiment Overrated: While AI is undoubtedly a significant driver for $NVDA's growth, there's a risk of the sentiment becoming overinflated, leading to potential market corrections.
(4) P/E Concerns: The current price-to-earnings ratio may not fully justify the stock's valuation, especially considering the competitive landscape within the chip industry.
(5)Recent Price Action: After a rapid 50% surge in just one month, a 15-20% pullback would not be unreasonable as investors take profits and the hype around AI cools off.

Given these factors, it's prudent for traders to make informed decisions and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risk effectively. Balancing both bullish and bearish plays could offer a more optimal approach to navigating the current market conditions.",49,15,
